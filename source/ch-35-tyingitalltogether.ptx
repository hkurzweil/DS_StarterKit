      <title>Case Study 1: "School Community Survey" - Multi-Variable Investigation Project</title>
      
      <p>
        <alert>Teacher Background:</alert> Maria teaches fourth grade in a suburban school with 28 students. She wanted to help students understand their school community while developing skills in survey design, data collection, and analysis with multiple variables.

        <title>The Great School Community Data Investigation</title>
        <p>
          <alert>The Project Overview:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Over three weeks, Maria's students designed and conducted a comprehensive survey of their school community, analyzing multiple variables and creating presentations for school administrators. The project integrated social studies (community understanding), math (data analysis), and language arts (communication skills).

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.2.1 Designing data-based investigations</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We started by brainstorming what we wanted to know about our school community," Maria explains. "This connects directly to B.2.1—students were designing an investigation requiring collection of data involving multiple variables. They naturally wanted to explore questions that would require gathering information about different groups and comparing responses."
        </p>
        <p>
          The students developed investigation questions through class discussion:
        </p>
        <p>
          • How do transportation methods vary by grade level?
        </p>
        <p>
          • What after-school activities are most popular among different age groups?
        </p>
        <p>
          • Do students in different grades prefer different lunch options?
        </p>
        <p>
          • How do family sizes compare across our school community?
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: A.1.1 Data types and forms</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "As we planned our survey, students began distinguishing between different types of data," Maria notes. "A.1.1 for grades 3-5 focuses on utilizing both categorical and numeric data and distinguishing when data is categorical versus numeric. Students could identify that grade level and transportation method were categorical, while family size was numeric."
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Survey Design Process:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Students worked in teams to create survey questions, learning to:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Write clear, unbiased questions
        </p>
        <p>
          • Choose appropriate response formats (multiple choice vs. numeric)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Consider how to collect demographic information (grade level, age)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Plan for data organization and analysis
        </p>

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.3.1 Creating your own data</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students collected data from different grade levels throughout the school," Maria explains. "B.3.1 emphasizes understanding that a variable measures the same characteristic on several individuals. My students grasped that 'transportation method' was measured the same way for each person they surveyed, creating comparable data across all respondents."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students collected data from 150+ respondents across grades K-5, recording:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Respondent grade level and age
        </p>
        <p>
          • Transportation to school (walk, bike, car, bus)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Favorite lunch option (pizza, salad, sandwich, hot meal)
        </p>
        <p>
          • After-school activities (sports, clubs, homework help, none)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Family size (number of people in household)
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.1.2 Organizing and structure</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We organized our data into structured tables with labeled rows and columns," Maria notes. "This connects to B.1.2—students collected and organized data about objects or events with multiple attributes, progressing from simple recording to structured tables that would support analysis."
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: C.1.4 Frequency tables</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students created frequency tables and calculated percentages to compare responses across groups," Maria explains. "C.1.4 for grades 3-5 focuses on summarizing data with fractions, relative frequencies, or proportions to make comparisons. Students could say '40% of third graders walk to school compared to only 15% of fifth graders.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Students discovered patterns like:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Younger students were more likely to walk or be driven to school
        </p>
        <p>
          • Older students participated in more after-school activities
        </p>
        <p>
          • Pizza was universally popular across all grade levels
        </p>
        <p>
          • Family sizes averaged between 3-4 people across all groups
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: E.1.1 Sense-making with visualizations</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students created multiple types of graphs to show their findings," Maria observes. "E.1.1 for this grade level involves creating data visualizations to summarize categorical data. They made bar graphs comparing transportation methods by grade level and pie charts showing the distribution of after-school activities."
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: E.2.1 Connect narratives and data visualizations</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Students prepared presentations for the principal and school board, explaining their findings and recommendations. "E.2.1 focuses on evaluating how visualizations and their surrounding text support each other," Maria explains. "Students had to ensure their graphs clearly supported their spoken conclusions about the school community."

          "We began by exploring what students wondered about our outdoor spaces," David explains. "A.3.1 for grades 3-5 involves planning and conducting investigations to answer questions using basic data organization and visualization. Students developed sophisticated questions that would require systematic data collection over time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Research questions developed by students:

        <p>
          • How does plant growth change over time in different areas of our playground?
        </p>
        <p>
          • What weather conditions affect when and where we see different animals?
        </p>
        <p>
          • How do student usage patterns change throughout the day and week?
        </p>
        <p>
          • Is there a relationship between weather and how students use outdoor spaces?

          <alert>The Project Overview:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Over six weeks, Jennifer's students tracked detailed reading data, analyzed patterns in their reading choices and progress, and used their findings to make recommendations for improving classroom reading programs. The project enhanced reading motivation while building data analysis skills.

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.3.1 Creating your own data</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students designed comprehensive reading logs that tracked multiple aspects of their reading experience," Jennifer explains. "B.3.1 emphasizes understanding that variables measure the same characteristic across multiple individuals. Students understood they were measuring 'reading time,' 'genre preference,' and 'comprehension rating' consistently for every book they read."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students tracked multiple variables for each book:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Book title, author, and genre
        </p>
        <p>
          • Number of pages and reading level
        </p>
        <p>
          • Time spent reading (daily and total)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Reading location (home, school, library)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Comprehension self-rating (1-5 scale)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Enjoyment rating (1-5 scale)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Recommendation (yes/no/maybe)
        </p>

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: A.1.1 Data types and forms</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "As students designed their tracking system, they naturally categorized different types of information," Jennifer notes. "A.1.1 for grades 3-5 focuses on distinguishing when data is categorical versus numeric. Students identified that genre and author were categorical data, while pages read and ratings were numeric data."

          <alert>Weeks 3-4: Data Collection and Initial Analysis</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Students collected reading data daily, with mini-analysis sessions each Friday to identify emerging patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: C.1.4 Frequency tables</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Every Friday, students organized their data into frequency tables to see their reading patterns," Jennifer explains. "C.1.4 emphasizes summarizing data with fractions, relative frequencies, or proportions. Students could calculate that '60% of my reading time this week was spent on mystery books' or 'I read 75% of my books at home versus 25% at school.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Weekly analysis activities included:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Counting books by genre and calculating percentages
        </p>
        <p>
          • Tracking total pages read and average reading speed
        </p>
        <p>
          • Comparing comprehension and enjoyment ratings
        </p>
        <p>
          • Analyzing reading time patterns throughout the week
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: C.2.3 Defining relationships</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students began creating time-series graphs showing how their reading patterns changed over the weeks," Jennifer notes. "C.2.3 includes creating time-series graphs to determine change in variables over time. Students could see if their reading speed increased or if their genre preferences shifted."

        </p>
        <p>
          "Students calculated their average reading time per day, typical comprehension scores, and median enjoyment ratings," Jennifer explains. "C.1.1 involves calculating summaries for categorical and numeric data. Students understood that their 'average enjoyment rating of 4.2' meant they typically enjoyed their books."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students discovered individual and class patterns:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Personal reading speed variations by genre and time of day
        </p>
        <p>
          • Correlation between book length and completion rates
        </p>
        <p>
          • Relationship between comprehension and enjoyment ratings
        </p>
        <p>
          • Class preferences for certain authors and series
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          "Students created multiple types of graphs to show their findings," Jennifer observes. "E.1.1 for this level involves creating data visualizations that use multiple variables. They made scatter plots showing the relationship between book length and enjoyment, and bar graphs comparing class reading preferences."

          <alert>Integration Guidelines:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          • Technology should enable more sophisticated analysis, not replace understanding
        </p>
        <p>
          • Students should be able to explain their process without the technology
        </p>
        <p>
          • Use technology when it provides access to real-world data or collaboration
        </p>
        <p>
          • Choose tools that are intuitive and don't distract from data thinking

          <alert>Balancing Strategies:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          • Start each new concept with hands-on exploration
        </p>
        <p>
          • Introduce technology when students understand the underlying process
        </p>
        <p>
          • Regularly return to non-digital methods for problem-solving and checking

    <title>Stories Wrap-Up: Growing Data Scientists in Grades 3-5</title>
    
    <p>
      These classroom stories demonstrate that students in grades 3-5 are capable of sophisticated data science thinking when provided with appropriate structure, support, and authentic investigation opportunities. At this level, students can handle multiple variables, complex analysis, and real-world applications while developing both subject-area knowledge and data science skills.
    </p>

    <note xml:id="final-stories-reflection-3-5">
      <title>Key Takeaways from 3-5 Implementation</title>
      <p>
        • <alert>Embrace complexity gradually:</alert> Students can handle sophisticated investigations when complexity is introduced systematically
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Leverage cross-curricular connections:</alert> Data science enhances learning across all subjects while building thinking skills
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Support mathematical development:</alert> Data investigations provide meaningful contexts for practicing computational skills
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Encourage real-world applications:</alert> Students are motivated by investigations that connect to their communities and interests
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Plan for extended investigations:</alert> Complex questions require time to develop, investigate, and communicate effectively
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Balance technology thoughtfully:</alert> Digital tools should enhance understanding, not replace conceptual development
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Foster collaboration skills:</alert> Multi-variable investigations benefit from team-based data collection and analysis
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      The template and examples in this chapter provide starting points for developing investigations that challenge students appropriately while building toward the more sophisticated data science work they'll encounter in middle school. Remember that every classroom and community is different—these examples should inspire your own creative adaptations rather than prescribe exact implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most importantly, continue to trust students' curiosity and capability. When you provide opportunities for grades 3-5 students to investigate questions they care about using multiple variables and data sources, you're building critical thinking skills, mathematical reasoning, and scientific habits of mind that will serve them throughout their education and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next chapter will explore how these foundational skills develop into even more sophisticated data science thinking in grades 6-8, where students are ready for statistical concepts, larger datasets, and more complex analysis techniques.
