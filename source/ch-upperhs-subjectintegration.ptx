    <title>Mathematics: Advanced Research and Innovation Leadership</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Senior-level mathematics becomes a tool for conducting cutting-edge research that pushes the boundaries of mathematical knowledge while solving complex real-world problems. Students can contribute original mathematical insights, develop new analytical methods, and lead innovation in mathematical applications. At this level, traditional mathematical concepts become powerful tools for analyzing authentic data and addressing real-world challenges.

    <subsection xml:id="grades11-12-math-traditional-enhancement">
      <title>Traditional Mathematics Enhancement: Data Science Integration in Core Curriculum</title>
      
      <p>
        Senior students can experience traditional mathematical concepts like logarithms, exponential functions, and regression analysis through sophisticated data science applications that reveal the real-world power of these mathematical tools. Rather than learning abstract concepts in isolation, students explore advanced mathematics through meaningful research questions that require authentic mathematical modeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following video from Bootstrap World demonstrates how traditional Algebra 2 concepts can be transformed into powerful data science learning experiences. Emmanuel Schanzer shows how students can explore logarithmic modeling using real-world health and economic data, creating opportunities for deep mathematical understanding while addressing important global questions.

        <em>Data Science Integration in Algebra 2: Bootstrap's Approach to Mathematical Modeling</em> - Bootstrap's Emmanuel Schanzer demonstrates how traditional Algebra 2 concepts like logarithms, exponential functions, and regression can be taught through authentic data science projects. Students explore the relationship between poverty and health using real country-level data, learning to fit logarithmic models and perform data transformations while engaging with meaningful social questions.
      </p>
