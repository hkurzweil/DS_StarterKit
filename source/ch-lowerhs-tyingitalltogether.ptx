        <p>
          <alert>The Project Overview:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Over a full semester, Dr. Washington's students conducted a comprehensive statistical investigation using longitudinal data from the state education department, examining factors that predict college enrollment, persistence, and graduation rates across different demographic groups. The project integrated advanced statistical methods, machine learning concepts, and policy analysis while addressing critical questions about educational equity.

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: D.2.1 Verifiable questions and statements</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students began by conducting systematic literature reviews of existing education research," Dr. Washington explains. "D.2.1 for grades 9-10 emphasizes differentiating query-based, hypothesis-based, and causal questions by their focus on trends, uniqueness of outcomes, and causal relationships. Students had to formulate hypotheses that could be tested using available longitudinal data while understanding the limitations of observational studies."
        </p>
        <p>
          Student research hypotheses included:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Students with higher high school GPA and rigorous coursework will have significantly higher college enrollment and persistence rates, controlling for socioeconomic factors
        </p>
        <p>
          • The relationship between standardized test scores and college success varies significantly across different demographic groups
        </p>
        <p>
          • Early college interventions (dual enrollment, college visits) predict success even after controlling for academic preparation
        </p>
        <p>
          • Financial aid packaging strategies have differential effects on persistence across income levels
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: A.1.2 Data are produced by people</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We spent considerable time examining how educational data is collected and the decisions that shape what gets measured," Dr. Washington notes. "A.1.2 for this level involves exploring the origins of standardized unit measurements and understanding that data is generated by people who make decisions about what and how to measure. Students learned that college 'success' metrics reflect particular values and priorities."

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.4.1 Cleanliness</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Students encountered professional-level data cleaning challenges," Dr. Washington explains. "B.4.1 for grades 9-10 involves working with datasets requiring multiple types of cleaning and developing and documenting reproducible data cleaning workflows. Students learned that real educational data has missing values due to student mobility, privacy restrictions, and institutional reporting differences."
        </p>
        <p>
          Data quality challenges included:
        </p>
        <p>

          "Students conducted sophisticated analyses including multiple regression, logistic regression, and survival analysis," Dr. Washington explains. "C.2.3 for this level involves describing associations between two categorical variables using measures such as difference in proportions and relative risk, and conducting linear regression analysis to find best-fit relationships."
        </p>
        <p>
          Statistical analyses included:

        </p>
        <p>
          "Students learned to communicate statistical findings using formal and informal uncertainty language," Dr. Washington notes. "D.1.1 for this level involves clearly stating results with degrees of certainty using advanced statistical methods while justifying conclusions with evidence quality indicators like dataset characteristics and source reliability."
        </p>
        <p>
          Key findings included:
        </p>
        <p>
          • High school GPA predicted college success better than standardized test scores, with 95% confidence intervals of [0.67, 0.89] for the correlation
        </p>
        <p>
          • Students from low-income families showed 23% lower persistence rates even after controlling for academic preparation (p &lt; 0.001)

        <p>
          Ms. Thompson teaches AP Statistics and wanted to incorporate real-world data science projects, but worried about covering all required topics for the AP exam. "My students love the authentic research projects, but I'm concerned they won't be prepared for the multiple choice questions and formal hypothesis testing procedures on the AP exam."

    <title>Stories Wrap-Up: Launching Data Science Careers and College Success</title>
    
    <p>
      These classroom stories demonstrate that high school students can engage in sophisticated statistical analysis, contribute meaningfully to professional research, and develop the skills needed for success in college and data science careers. At this level, students become independent researchers, community advocates, and emerging professionals who use data science as a tool for understanding and improving the world.

        • <alert>Professional-level capabilities:</alert> Students can conduct authentic research that contributes to community knowledge and decision-making
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>College preparation excellence:</alert> Rigorous statistical education through authentic application prepares students for advanced coursework
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Career pathway development:</alert> Professional partnerships and mentorship provide concrete career exploration and preparation
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Ethical reasoning maturity:</alert> Students develop sophisticated understanding of responsible data science practice
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Independent research capabilities:</alert> Students can design, execute, and communicate original research investigations
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Community impact focus:</alert> Students learn to use data science for social good and democratic participation
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Technical skill integration:</alert> Advanced tools serve statistical thinking rather than replacing it
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      The investigations and partnerships described in this chapter represent the culmination of K-12 data science education, where students demonstrate college-level capabilities while contributing to real-world problem-solving. These experiences build both technical competence and ethical reasoning while showing that high school students can make meaningful contributions to research, policy, and community improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frameworks and examples provide models for developing advanced data science programs that serve as bridges to college and career success. Successful implementation requires strong professional partnerships, advanced teacher preparation, and institutional support for innovative approaches to high school education.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most importantly, these stories demonstrate that when we provide high school students with authentic research opportunities, professional mentorship, and appropriate support systems, they develop not only technical skills but also the confidence, competence, and commitment to use data science for positive change throughout their lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final chapter will explore how these foundations support advanced data science thinking in grades 11-12, where students engage in independent research projects, internship experiences, and preparation for the most rigorous college-level data science courses.
