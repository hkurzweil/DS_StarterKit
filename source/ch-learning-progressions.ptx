    <subsection xml:id="ethics-as-foundation">
      <title>Ethics as Foundation, Not Afterthought</title>
      
      <p>
        Notice that the progressions begin with <q>Data Disposition</q> and that ethical considerations appear in multiple themes, especially "Understanding Our Data-Driven World." Ethics isn't something we add on later - it's fundamental to all data science learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even young students can engage with ethical thinking about data:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> <em>K-2:</em> <q>Should we ask permission before sharing information about our friends?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> <em>3-5:</em> <q>How might our survey questions make some students feel left out?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> <em>6-8:</em> <q>What are the benefits and risks of collecting this data?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\bullet</m> <em>9-12:</em> <q>How might bias in our data affect our conclusions?</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        This ethical foundation builds students' capacity for responsible citizenship in our data-driven world and connects directly to outcomes like "Ethics During Analysis," "Bias in AI," and "Societal Implications."

      <title>Final Reflection: Your Data Science Teaching Identity</title>
      <p>
        Take a few minutes to reflect on your journey through this chapter:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. What was the most surprising thing you learned about data science education?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. How has your understanding of your role as a data science educator evolved?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Which of the five themes feels most connected to your current teaching strengths?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. What connections do you see between the themes/outcomes and your subject area that you hadn't noticed before?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. What's one specific outcome you'll focus on in the next two weeks?
      </p>
      <p>
        6. When you're ready for more detailed planning, which strands do you want to explore first?
      </p>
      <p>
        7. What support do you need as you continue this journey?
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      You're now ready to dive into the specific needs and opportunities of your grade band. The foundation you've built in understanding both the manageable themes and the comprehensive progressions will serve you well as you get more specific about implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In your next chapter, you'll explore how these themes and progressions play out specifically in your grade band, with concrete examples, common challenges, and practical strategies for bringing data science thinking to life in your classroom. You'll see how the outcomes translate into age-appropriate activities and how the strand progressions provide detailed developmental guidance when you need it.
