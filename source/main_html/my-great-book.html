At its core, data science combines three essential elements: domain expertise (knowing about the subject area), mathematical and statistical skills, and computational thinking. Think of it as detective work—data scientists ask questions, gather evidence (data), analyze patterns, and draw conclusions that can inform decisions and actions.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-what-is-data-science-3">But data science isn’t just about numbers and computers. It’s fundamentally about curiosity, critical thinking, and communication. Data scientists must ask good questions, think creatively about how to find answers, and then share their findings in ways that others can understand and act upon. These are skills that align perfectly with what we want to develop in our students across all subject areas.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-what-is-data-science-4">The data science process typically follows a cycle: we start with a question or problem, collect and organize relevant data, explore and analyze that data to find patterns, create models or visualizations to represent our findings, and then communicate our results to others. This cycle mirrors the scientific method and inquiry-based learning that many educators already use in their classrooms.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-what-is-data-science-5">What makes data science particularly powerful in education is its interdisciplinary nature. Data science problems often require knowledge from multiple fields—science, mathematics, social studies, language arts, and more. This makes it an excellent vehicle for integrated learning and helps students see connections across different areas of knowledge.</div></section><section class="section" id="sec-data-science-in-k12"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<div class="para" id="sec-data-science-in-k12-2">Data science in K-12 education isn’t about turning elementary students into professional data analysts. Instead, it’s about developing data literacy—the ability to read, work with, analyze, and communicate with data. Just as we teach students to be literate with text, we need to help them become literate with data, which is increasingly the language through which our world communicates.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-data-science-in-k12-3">In the K-12 context, data science education focuses on building foundational skills that students will use throughout their lives. These include asking investigative questions, collecting and organizing information, identifying patterns and trends, making evidence-based arguments, and communicating findings clearly. These skills develop progressively from elementary through high school, with activities appropriate for each developmental stage.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-data-science-in-k12-4">Data science education also emphasizes real-world relevance and student agency. Students work with data about topics they care about—from their local community to global issues—and use their findings to take action or make recommendations. This approach helps students see themselves as capable of understanding and influencing the world around them through data-driven inquiry.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-data-science-in-k12-5">Perhaps most importantly, K-12 data science education includes a strong focus on ethics and responsible data use. Students learn to question data sources, consider bias and fairness, protect privacy, and think critically about how data is collected and used. In our digital age, these skills are essential for informed citizenship and personal well-being.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-data-science-in-k12-6">The integration of data science in K-12 doesn’t require completely restructuring your curriculum. Instead, it often involves enhancing existing activities with data science thinking—asking students to collect data about their science experiments, analyze historical trends in social studies, or explore patterns in literature. It’s about cultivating a mindset of inquiry and evidence-based reasoning across all subjects.</div></section><section class="section" id="sec-panel-discussion1"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="ch-overcoming-anxiety-2"><div class="para" id="ch-overcoming-anxiety-2-1">If you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed after reading the first chapter, you’re not alone. Many educators hear "data science" and immediately think they need to become expert programmers or statisticians overnight. The truth is far from that—and this chapter is here to help you see why you’re already more prepared than you think.</div>
<div class="para" id="ch-overcoming-anxiety-2-2">Let’s address the elephant in the room: you don’t need a computer science degree to integrate data science thinking into your classroom. You don’t need to be a math wizard or a coding expert. What you need are the skills you already possess as an educator—curiosity, the ability to ask good questions, and the talent for helping students make sense of their world.</div>
<div class="para" id="ch-overcoming-anxiety-2-3">In this chapter, we’ll reframe what data science really means for K-12 education, help you recognize the data science skills you’re already using, and show you how embracing a learning mindset alongside your students can be one of your greatest teaching tools. Most importantly, we’ll help you see that your "beginner’s mind" is actually an asset, not a limitation.</div></section><section class="section" id="sec-reframing-expertise"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Section</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.1</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">Reframing What "Expertise" Means</span>
</h3>
<div class="para" id="sec-reframing-expertise-2">One of the biggest barriers to integrating data science in K-12 education is the misconception that teachers need to be experts before they can guide students. This thinking comes from traditional models where teachers were expected to know everything before presenting it to students. But data science education—and modern pedagogy in general—works differently.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-reframing-expertise-3">In data science, the most valuable skill isn’t knowing all the answers; it’s knowing how to ask good questions and how to find reliable ways to explore those questions. As a teacher, you’ve been doing this your entire career. Every time you help a student work through a problem, every time you design a lesson that builds on prior knowledge, every time you assess student understanding and adjust your instruction—you’re demonstrating the core thinking processes of data science.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-reframing-expertise-4">Consider this: when students struggle with a concept, do you immediately give them the answer, or do you guide them through questions that help them discover the solution themselves? The latter approach is exactly what data scientists do when faced with a new problem. They don’t panic about not knowing the answer—they get curious about how to find it.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-reframing-expertise-5">Your role in data science education isn’t to be the expert who has all the answers. Your role is to be the expert facilitator who knows how to create conditions for learning, how to ask questions that spark curiosity, and how to support students as they develop their own understanding. These are skills you already have in abundance.</div></section><section class="section" id="sec-skills-you-already-have"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Section</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.2</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="title">The Data Science Skills You’re Already Using</span>
</h3>
<div class="para" id="sec-skills-you-already-have-2">Every day in your classroom, you engage in sophisticated data analysis without even realizing it. When you look at assessment results and notice that several students missed the same type of problem, you’re identifying patterns in data. When you track student progress over time and adjust your instruction based on what you see, you’re using data to make informed decisions. When you help students make connections between different concepts or subjects, you’re teaching them to synthesize information from multiple sources.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-skills-you-already-have-3">Think about how you analyze your students’ learning. You don’t just look at test scores—you observe behaviors, listen to discussions, review work samples, and consider individual circumstances. You’re constantly collecting multiple types of data, looking for patterns, and drawing conclusions that inform your next steps. This is exactly what data scientists do in their work.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-skills-you-already-have-4">When you help students make sense of a story, you guide them to identify key information, recognize patterns in character development or plot structure, and draw conclusions based on evidence from the text. When you facilitate a discussion about historical events, you’re helping students analyze multiple sources, consider different perspectives, and form evidence-based opinions. These are fundamental data science skills applied in language arts and social studies contexts.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-skills-you-already-have-5">Even your approach to classroom management involves data science thinking. You notice which strategies work with different students, you track patterns in behavior over time, and you adjust your approach based on evidence of what’s most effective. You’re already a practicing data scientist—you just haven’t been calling it that.</div></section><section class="section" id="sec-power-of-learning-together"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<div class="para" id="sec-power-of-learning-together-2">Here’s a secret that might surprise you: some of the most effective data science teachers are those who don’t come from technical backgrounds. Why? Because they understand something crucial about learning—it’s okay not to know everything, and there’s tremendous power in discovering things together.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-power-of-learning-together-3">When you approach data science as a co-learner with your students, you model something incredibly valuable: that learning is a lifelong process, that making mistakes is part of learning, and that curiosity is more important than having all the answers. Students who see their teacher genuinely engaged in learning are more likely to take intellectual risks themselves.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-power-of-learning-together-4">Think about the most memorable learning experiences you’ve had as an adult. Chances are, they involved some struggle, some uncertainty, and some breakthrough moments where things finally clicked. When you allow your students to see this process in action, you’re teaching them that learning isn’t about being perfect—it’s about being persistent, curious, and willing to revise your thinking based on new evidence.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-power-of-learning-together-5">Your willingness to say "I don’t know, but let’s figure it out together" is actually a superpower in data science education. It creates an environment where students feel safe to explore, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. It shifts the classroom dynamic from "teacher as information deliverer" to "classroom as learning community," which is exactly the kind of environment where data science thinking thrives.</div></section><section class="section" id="sec-starting-small-building-confidence"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<div class="para" id="sec-starting-small-building-confidence-2">The key to successfully integrating data science into your teaching isn’t to completely overhaul your curriculum overnight. Instead, it’s about starting with small modifications to things you’re already doing well. Every successful data science integration began with a teacher who decided to try one small thing differently.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-starting-small-building-confidence-3">Maybe it’s asking students to collect data about something they’re curious about instead of just researching facts online. Maybe it’s having students create a simple chart or graph to represent information they’ve gathered instead of just writing a paragraph. Maybe it’s encouraging students to look for patterns in historical events or literary themes instead of just memorizing isolated facts.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-starting-small-building-confidence-4">The beauty of starting small is that it allows you to build confidence gradually. Each small success gives you the courage to try something slightly more ambitious next time. And your students will grow alongside you—they’ll get more comfortable with data-focused thinking, and you’ll get more comfortable facilitating these kinds of investigations.</div>
<div class="para" id="sec-starting-small-building-confidence-5">Remember, you don’t need fancy technology or complex datasets to begin. Some of the most powerful data science learning happens with simple tools and student-generated data.

<div class="para" id="chapter-data-moves-9-2">Data moves are the fundamental building blocks of data analysis, providing the tools to transform raw data into forms that support meaningful investigation. The six core moves — filtering, grouping, summarizing, calculating, merging, and making hierarchy — can be combined in countless ways to address diverse analytical questions.</div>
<div class="para" id="chapter-data-moves-9-3">Mastering data moves requires both technical skills and conceptual understanding. You need to know not just how to perform these transformations, but when to use them, how they affect your data, and what ethical considerations they raise. This understanding becomes increasingly important as data plays a larger role in society and decision-making.</div>
<div class="para" id="chapter-data-moves-9-4">The learning progressions provide a roadmap for developing these skills across educational levels, from basic sorting and counting in elementary grades to sophisticated analytical techniques in advanced courses. By grounding data moves in this developmental framework, we can build students’ capacity to engage critically and creatively with data throughout their lives.</div>
<div class="para" id="chapter-data-moves-9-5">As you continue your data science journey, remember that data moves are means to an end — they help you explore questions, test hypotheses, and communicate insights. The most important skill is learning to ask good questions and then selecting and sequencing data moves to help answer them in ways that are accurate, ethical, and meaningful.</div></section></section><section class="backmatter" id="backmatter"><section class="colophon" id="backmatter-2"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

As educators, you're already working with data every day—from tracking student progress to analyzing assessment results. This chapter will help you understand how data science can transform not just how you use data in your classroom, but how you can empower your students to become critical thinkers and problem-solvers in our data-driven world.  In this chapter, we'll explore what data science really means, discover how it's already present in K-12 education, and provide you with practical tools for reflection and implementation. Whether you're completely new to data science or looking to deepen your understanding, this chapter will give you the foundation you need to confidently integrate data science thinking into your teaching practice.    What is Data Science?  Data science is the art and science of extracting meaningful insights from data to solve real-world problems. At its core, data science combines three essential elements: domain expertise (knowing about the subject area), mathematical and statistical skills, and computational thinking. Think of it as detective work—data scientists ask questions, gather evidence (data), analyze patterns, and draw conclusions that can inform decisions and actions.  But data science isn't just about numbers and computers. It's fundamentally about curiosity, critical thinking, and communication. Data scientists must ask good questions, think creatively about how to find answers, and then share their findings in ways that others can understand and act upon. These are skills that align perfectly with what we want to develop in our students across all subject areas.  The data science process typically follows a cycle: we start with a question or problem, collect and organize relevant data, explore and analyze that data to find patterns, create models or visualizations to represent our findings, and then communicate our results to others. This cycle mirrors the scientific method and inquiry-based learning that many educators already use in their classrooms.  What makes data science particularly powerful in education is its interdisciplinary nature. Data science problems often require knowledge from multiple fields—science, mathematics, social studies, language arts, and more. This makes it an excellent vehicle for integrated learning and helps students see connections across different areas of knowledge.    Data Science in K-12 Education  Data science in K-12 education isn't about turning elementary students into professional data analysts. Instead, it's about developing data literacy—the ability to read, work with, analyze, and communicate with data. Just as we teach students to be literate with text, we need to help them become literate with data, which is increasingly the language through which our world communicates.  In the K-12 context, data science education focuses on building foundational skills that students will use throughout their lives. These include asking investigative questions, collecting and organizing information, identifying patterns and trends, making evidence-based arguments, and communicating findings clearly. These skills develop progressively from elementary through high school, with activities appropriate for each developmental stage.  Data science education also emphasizes real-world relevance and student agency. Students work with data about topics they care about—from their local community to global issues—and use their findings to take action or make recommendations. This approach helps students see themselves as capable of understanding and influencing the world around them through data-driven inquiry.  Perhaps most importantly, K-12 data science education includes a strong focus on ethics and responsible data use. Students learn to question data sources, consider bias and fairness, protect privacy, and think critically about how data is collected and used. In our digital age, these skills are essential for informed citizenship and personal well-being.  The integration of data science in K-12 doesn't require completely restructuring your curriculum. Instead, it often involves enhancing existing activities with data science thinking—asking students to collect data about their science experiments, analyze historical trends in social studies, or explore patterns in literature. It's about cultivating a mindset of inquiry and evidence-based reasoning across all subjects.    Expert Perspectives: Panel Discussion  To deepen your understanding of data science in education, watch this panel discussion featuring educators and data science experts who share their insights on implementing data science in K-12 classrooms. Pay attention to the practical strategies they discuss and the challenges they've overcome.   Panel Discussion: Data Science in K-12 Education    Note: This panel discussion features educators and data science experts discussing practical approaches to integrating data science in K-12 classrooms, sharing success stories, challenges, and actionable strategies for teachers.   As you watch, consider how the panelists' experiences might relate to your own teaching context. What resonates with your current practice? What challenges do they mention that you might face? What opportunities do you see for your students?    Reflection and Self-Assessment   Reflecting on Your Current Practice   Think about your current teaching practice and respond to the following prompts. There are no right or wrong answers—this is about understanding where you are now and where you'd like to go.     Describe a recent lesson or activity where your students worked with information or data (this could be as simple as counting, measuring, or researching facts). What did students do with that information?    What questions do your students naturally ask about their world? List 2-3 questions that come up regularly in your classroom.    How comfortable do you feel with technology and data tools? Rate yourself on a scale of 1-5 and explain your reasoning.    What excites you most about the possibility of incorporating data science thinking into your teaching? What concerns you most?        Identifying Data Literacy Skills in Your Curriculum   Review the following data literacy skills and identify where they might already exist in your curriculum or where you could incorporate them.      Asking investigative questions: Where in your curriculum do students already ask questions that could be answered with data? How might you encourage more data-focused questions?     Collecting and organizing information: What opportunities do students have to gather and organize data in your classroom? How could you expand these opportunities?     Identifying patterns: In what contexts do your students look for patterns? How could you help them develop stronger pattern recognition skills?     Communicating findings: How do your students currently share what they've learned? What new formats could you introduce for data communication?        Capturing Student Curiosity   Over the next week, keep a record of questions your students ask that could potentially be answered with data. Use this space to brainstorm how you might turn one of these questions into a data science investigation.     List 3-5 questions your students have asked recently that sparked your curiosity.    Choose one question that interests you most. What kind of data might help answer this question? Where could you and your students find this data?    How could you involve students in collecting, analyzing, or interpreting data related to this question?         Applications to Your Teaching Practice  Now that you've reflected on data science and your current practice, it's time to think about concrete next steps. The goal isn't to completely transform your teaching overnight, but to identify small, manageable ways to begin incorporating data science thinking into your classroom.   Identifying Quick Wins   Quick wins are small changes that can have a big impact. These are low-risk ways to begin integrating data science thinking without requiring major curriculum overhauls or new technology.     Think of an upcoming lesson or unit. How could you add a simple data collection or analysis component? For example, students could survey classmates, measure objects, count occurrences, or research statistics online.    What's one question you could pose to your students that would require them to gather evidence or data to answer? How would they share their findings?    How could you incorporate more \"why\" and \"what if\" questions into your teaching? These questions often lead naturally to data investigations.        Making Cross-Curricular Connections   Data science thrives on interdisciplinary connections. Consider how you might connect different subject areas through data-focused investigations.     If you teach multiple subjects, identify a topic or theme that appears in more than one area. How could students use data to explore this topic from multiple perspectives?    If you teach a single subject, think about connections to other disciplines. How does your subject area connect to science, social studies, mathematics, or language arts through data?    How could you collaborate with colleagues in other subject areas to create a shared data science investigation?        Creating Your Action Plan   Based on your reflections in this chapter, create a concrete action plan for incorporating data science thinking into your practice.      This week: What's one small step you'll take this week to begin integrating data science thinking? Be specific about what you'll do and when.     This month: What's a slightly larger goal you'd like to accomplish within the next month? This might involve planning a lesson, trying a new activity, or having a conversation with a colleague.     This semester\/year: What's your bigger vision for incorporating data science in your teaching? What would success look like for you and your students?     Support needed: What resources, training, or support would help you achieve these goals? How might you access this support?       Remember, integrating data science into your teaching is a journey, not a destination. Start small, experiment, and learn alongside your students. The most important step is the first one—and you've already taken it by engaging with this chapter and reflecting on your practice.    Congratulations on completing the first chapter of your data science education journey! You've explored what data science means, considered its role in K-12 education, and reflected deeply on your own teaching practice. Most importantly, you've begun to envision how data science thinking can enhance your students' learning experiences.  As you move forward, remember that data science education is ultimately about empowering students to ask better questions, think critically about information, and use evidence to understand and improve their world. These are skills that will serve them well regardless of their future career paths, and they align perfectly with the goals of excellent education in any subject area.  In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into practical strategies and tools you can use to implement data science activities in your classroom. You'll discover age-appropriate approaches for different grade levels and explore specific examples of data science integration across various subjects.     Understanding Data Science Learning Progressions   This is a text to get a pull request from github. Data science learning progressions provide a roadmap for developing students' data literacy from kindergarten through grade 12. These progressions are organized into five interconnected strands that together form a comprehensive framework for data science education. Understanding these progressions will help you identify where your students are in their data science journey and plan instruction that builds systematically toward more sophisticated data practices.    The Five Strands of Data Science Learning   Strand A: Data Literacy and Responsibility   Focus: This strand establishes the foundational understanding of what data is and how it should be approached responsibly. It emphasizes that data is created by people, contains inherent variability, and provides only partial information about the world.   Why It Matters: In our data-driven society, students need to understand not just how to work with data, but what data represents and the ethical considerations involved in its collection and use. This strand develops critical thinking about data sources, biases, and the power dynamics involved in data work. Students learn to approach data with both curiosity and healthy skepticism.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students begin by recognizing that data can answer questions and that there are different types of information we can collect   3-5: Students understand that data is created by people making decisions about what to measure and how   6-8: Students recognize limitations in data and begin to identify bias and ethical considerations   9-10: Students analyze how data collection methods affect interpretation and develop strategies for responsible data use   11-12: Students critically evaluate data sources, understand complex ethical implications, and take agency in their own data practices    Strand B: Creation and Curation   Focus: This strand covers where data comes from and how it should be collected, organized, and formatted to be useful. It encompasses both creating new data and working with existing datasets, emphasizing that real-world data is often messy and requires careful curation.   Why It Matters: Students need to understand that high-quality analysis begins with high-quality data. This strand teaches students to be thoughtful about data collection methods, to recognize and address data quality issues, and to organize data in ways that facilitate meaningful analysis. These skills are essential for both consuming and producing reliable data-based conclusions.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students collect and organize simple data using basic tools like counting and sorting   3-5: Students design simple investigations and organize data in tables with multiple attributes   6-8: Students learn to clean data, identify errors and missing values, and work with more complex data structures   9-10: Students design sophisticated data collection methods, work with multiple datasets, and understand sampling and bias   11-12: Students develop comprehensive data management systems and work with complex, real-world datasets requiring advanced cleaning and organization    Strand C: Analysis and Modeling Techniques   Focus: This strand develops students' ability to analyze data using various techniques, from basic summary statistics to complex modeling approaches. It emphasizes understanding which techniques to use for different types of data and questions, and includes both traditional statistical methods and modern computational approaches.   Why It Matters: Analysis transforms raw data into insights. This strand ensures students can move beyond simply describing data to identifying patterns, relationships, and trends that inform decision-making. As data becomes increasingly complex and abundant, students need both conceptual understanding and practical skills with digital tools.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students describe data using simple comparisons and identify basic patterns through sorting and grouping   3-5: Students calculate simple summary statistics and use digital tools to create basic visualizations   6-8: Students work with measures of center and spread, identify relationships between variables, and begin using advanced digital tools   9-10: Students conduct statistical analyses, work with correlation and regression, and use simulation methods   11-12: Students apply advanced statistical techniques, work with machine learning concepts, and create sophisticated models    Strand D: Interpreting Problems and Results   Focus: This strand focuses on making and justifying claims from data within appropriate contexts. It emphasizes understanding the relationship between questions, data, and valid conclusions, including the limitations of what can be inferred from any dataset.   Why It Matters: The ability to draw valid conclusions from data is perhaps the most important skill in our information-rich world. This strand teaches students to think probabilistically, understand uncertainty, and communicate findings appropriately. It also develops skills in identifying when data supports or contradicts claims made by others.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students make simple claims based on data and recognize that different conclusions might be drawn from the same information   3-5: Students begin using probabilistic language and understand that conclusions should be supported by evidence   6-8: Students learn to qualify their conclusions with appropriate uncertainty language and recognize correlation versus causation   9-10: Students apply formal statistical concepts, understand sampling and generalization, and evaluate the strength of evidence   11-12: Students use advanced statistical inference, understand complex experimental design, and critically evaluate claims in media and research    Strand E: Visualization and Communication   Focus: This strand develops students' ability to create effective visualizations and communicate findings to different audiences. It encompasses both the technical skills of creating graphs and charts and the communication skills needed to tell compelling, accurate stories with data.   Why It Matters: Data visualization is both a tool for analysis and a medium for communication. Students need to understand how different visual representations highlight different aspects of data, and how to choose appropriate formats for their audiences and purposes. In a world filled with data visualizations, students also need to be critical consumers who can identify misleading or inappropriate visual representations.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students create simple visual representations like pictographs and bar charts using hands-on materials   3-5: Students use digital tools to create basic visualizations and begin connecting visuals to narratives   6-8: Students create more complex visualizations, understand design principles, and adapt their communication for different audiences   9-10: Students create sophisticated multi-variable visualizations, understand advanced design principles, and use data for advocacy   11-12: Students create publication-quality visualizations, understand accessibility considerations, and communicate complex analyses to diverse audiences     How the Strands Work Together  These five strands are not meant to be taught in isolation. Instead, they represent different aspects of data science practice that should be integrated throughout instruction. A single data science investigation might involve:   Strand A concepts when considering the source and limitations of data   Strand B skills when collecting and organizing the dataset   Strand C techniques when analyzing patterns and relationships   Strand D reasoning when interpreting results and making claims   Strand E communication when sharing findings with others  The learning progressions show how each strand develops sophistication over time, but students at any grade level can engage with concepts from all five strands at an appropriate level of complexity.

Many educators hear \"data science\" and immediately think they need to become expert programmers or statisticians overnight. The truth is far from that—and this chapter is here to help you see why you're already more prepared than you think.  Let's address the elephant in the room: you don't need a computer science degree to integrate data science thinking into your classroom. You don't need to be a math wizard or a coding expert. What you need are the skills you already possess as an educator—curiosity, the ability to ask good questions, and the talent for helping students make sense of their world.  In this chapter, we'll reframe what data science really means for K-12 education, help you recognize the data science skills you're already using, and show you how embracing a learning mindset alongside your students can be one of your greatest teaching tools. Most importantly, we'll help you see that your \"beginner's mind\" is actually an asset, not a limitation.    Reframing What \"Expertise\" Means  One of the biggest barriers to integrating data science in K-12 education is the misconception that teachers need to be experts before they can guide students. This thinking comes from traditional models where teachers were expected to know everything before presenting it to students. But data science education—and modern pedagogy in general—works differently.  In data science, the most valuable skill isn't knowing all the answers; it's knowing how to ask good questions and how to find reliable ways to explore those questions. As a teacher, you've been doing this your entire career. Every time you help a student work through a problem, every time you design a lesson that builds on prior knowledge, every time you assess student understanding and adjust your instruction—you're demonstrating the core thinking processes of data science.  Consider this: when students struggle with a concept, do you immediately give them the answer, or do you guide them through questions that help them discover the solution themselves? The latter approach is exactly what data scientists do when faced with a new problem. They don't panic about not knowing the answer—they get curious about how to find it.  Your role in data science education isn't to be the expert who has all the answers. Your role is to be the expert facilitator who knows how to create conditions for learning, how to ask questions that spark curiosity, and how to support students as they develop their own understanding. These are skills you already have in abundance.    The Data Science Skills You're Already Using  Every day in your classroom, you engage in sophisticated data analysis without even realizing it. When you look at assessment results and notice that several students missed the same type of problem, you're identifying patterns in data. When you track student progress over time and adjust your instruction based on what you see, you're using data to make informed decisions. When you help students make connections between different concepts or subjects, you're teaching them to synthesize information from multiple sources.  Think about how you analyze your students' learning. You don't just look at test scores—you observe behaviors, listen to discussions, review work samples, and consider individual circumstances. You're constantly collecting multiple types of data, looking for patterns, and drawing conclusions that inform your next steps. This is exactly what data scientists do in their work.  When you help students make sense of a story, you guide them to identify key information, recognize patterns in character development or plot structure, and draw conclusions based on evidence from the text. When you facilitate a discussion about historical events, you're helping students analyze multiple sources, consider different perspectives, and form evidence-based opinions. These are fundamental data science skills applied in language arts and social studies contexts.  Even your approach to classroom management involves data science thinking. You notice which strategies work with different students, you track patterns in behavior over time, and you adjust your approach based on evidence of what's most effective. You're already a practicing data scientist—you just haven't been calling it that.    The Power of Learning Alongside Your Students  Here's a secret that might surprise you: some of the most effective data science teachers are those who don't come from technical backgrounds. Why? Because they understand something crucial about learning—it's okay not to know everything, and there's tremendous power in discovering things together.  When you approach data science as a co-learner with your students, you model something incredibly valuable: that learning is a lifelong process, that making mistakes is part of learning, and that curiosity is more important than having all the answers. Students who see their teacher genuinely engaged in learning are more likely to take intellectual risks themselves.  Think about the most memorable learning experiences you've had as an adult. Chances are, they involved some struggle, some uncertainty, and some breakthrough moments where things finally clicked. When you allow your students to see this process in action, you're teaching them that learning isn't about being perfect—it's about being persistent, curious, and willing to revise your thinking based on new evidence.  Your willingness to say \"I don't know, but let's figure it out together\" is actually a superpower in data science education. It creates an environment where students feel safe to explore, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. It shifts the classroom dynamic from \"teacher as information deliverer\" to \"classroom as learning community,\" which is exactly the kind of environment where data science thinking thrives.    Starting Small and Building Confidence  The key to successfully integrating data science into your teaching isn't to completely overhaul your curriculum overnight. Instead, it's about starting with small modifications to things you're already doing well. Every successful data science integration began with a teacher who decided to try one small thing differently.  Maybe it's asking students to collect data about something they're curious about instead of just researching facts online. Maybe it's having students create a simple chart or graph to represent information they've gathered instead of just writing a paragraph. Maybe it's encouraging students to look for patterns in historical events or literary themes instead of just memorizing isolated facts.  The beauty of starting small is that it allows you to build confidence gradually. Each small success gives you the courage to try something slightly more ambitious next time. And your students will grow alongside you—they'll get more comfortable with data-focused thinking, and you'll get more comfortable facilitating these kinds of investigations.  Remember, you don't need fancy technology or complex datasets to begin. Some of the most powerful data science learning happens with simple tools and student-generated data. The sophistication comes from the thinking processes you guide students through, not from the tools you use.    Expert Perspectives: Panel Discussion  This panel discussion features educators and experts in the field who share their insights on the importance of tackling your data science anxiety, and even to broadcast that to your students, to impart some valuable data science (and life) lessons that they will carry with them forever about what it means to be a life-long learner.   Panel Discussion: Overcoming Data Anxiety    Note: This panel discussion features educators and data science experts discussing the very real challenge teachers face when integrating data science in their classrooms: their own anxiety and imposter syndrome.   As you watch, consider how the panelists' experiences might relate to your own teaching context. What resonates with your current practice? What challenges do they mention that you might face? What opportunities do you see for your students?    Reflection and Application: Embracing the Learning Journey  Now it's time to put these ideas into practice. This section will help you identify connections between data science and your existing strengths, while also planning low-stakes ways to begin integrating data science thinking into your classroom. Most importantly, we'll explore how to model the learning process for your students.   Modeling the Learning Process for Students   One of the most powerful ways to support student learning is to show them that learning involves iteration, making mistakes, and trying again. This is especially important in data science, where the process of investigation often involves false starts and course corrections.     Think about a time when you learned something new as an adult (this could be a hobby, a technology skill, a new teaching strategy, etc.). Describe the process: What did you try first? What didn't work? How did you adjust your approach? What finally helped it \"click\"?    How could you share this learning story with your students in a way that helps them understand that struggle and revision are normal parts of learning? What specific message would you want them to take away?    Think of an upcoming lesson or activity where students might struggle or make mistakes. How could you frame this as \"productive struggle\" rather than failure? What language could you use to normalize the process of trying, adjusting, and trying again?    How might you make your own learning process visible to students when you try data science activities together? What would it look like to genuinely learn alongside them rather than pretending to already know everything?        Connecting Data Science to Your Existing Strengths   Data science isn't as foreign as it might seem—it builds on thinking processes and skills you already use regularly. Let's identify these connections to build your confidence.      Data Science as Storytelling: How is working with data similar to helping students understand and tell stories? Consider how both involve identifying key information, recognizing patterns, making connections, and communicating findings to others. What specific storytelling skills do you use that could apply to data work?     Data Science as Student Assessment: Think about how you currently analyze student learning data (test scores, observations, work samples, etc.). What processes do you use to identify patterns, track progress, and make instructional decisions? How is this similar to what data scientists do?     Data Science as Problem-Solving: Describe your approach when you encounter a challenge in your teaching (low engagement, a concept students aren't grasping, etc.). How do you gather information, try different strategies, and evaluate what's working? How does this mirror the data science process?     Your Unique Strengths: What are you already really good at as a teacher? How might these strengths actually be advantages in data science education? (For example: strong questioning skills, ability to facilitate discussions, talent for making abstract concepts concrete, etc.)        Low-Stakes Ways to Involve Students in Data Work   Often, the most effective way to begin integrating data science is to \"offload\" some of the work you're already doing onto your students. This not only introduces them to data science thinking but often results in deeper learning and engagement.      Data Collection: Think about information you currently gather or present to students (attendance patterns, weather data for science, historical statistics, survey results, etc.). How could you have students collect this data themselves instead of you providing it? What would they learn from the collection process?     Pattern Recognition: Consider a lesson where you typically point out patterns or trends to students. How could you instead present the data and ask students to identify the patterns themselves? What questions could you ask to guide their analysis?     Making Comparisons: Think about times when you compare different options, time periods, locations, or approaches in your teaching. How could students collect and compare this data themselves? What tools could they use to organize and present their comparisons?     Classroom Management Data: What classroom routines or procedures could students help track and analyze? (Examples: time spent on different activities, participation patterns, effectiveness of different classroom arrangements, etc.) How might involving them in this analysis improve both their data skills and your classroom community?     Assessment and Reflection: How could students participate more actively in tracking and analyzing their own learning progress? What data could they collect about their own growth, challenges, or learning strategies?        Building Your Confidence Action Plan   Based on your reflections in this chapter, create a specific plan for building your confidence with data science while supporting your students' learning.      One Connection to Celebrate: Choose one connection between data science and your existing skills that most resonates with you. How will you remind yourself of this connection when you feel uncertain about trying data science activities?     One Low-Stakes Experiment: From your reflections above, choose one small change you could make in the next two weeks—something where you let students take on more of the data work. Be specific about what you'll try and when.     Learning Mindset Goal: How will you model the learning process for your students when you try this experiment? What will you say or do to show them that learning involves iteration and that mistakes are valuable?     Support System: Who could you share your data science learning journey with? This might be a colleague, a professional learning community, or even your students themselves. How could they support you as you try new approaches?     Reflection Plan: How will you track what you learn from this experience? What questions will you ask yourself after trying your low-stakes experiment? How will you use what you learn to plan your next step?       Remember, confidence in data science education doesn't come from knowing everything—it comes from being comfortable with the process of inquiry, willing to learn alongside your students, and confident in your ability to facilitate meaningful learning experiences. You already have these skills. Now it's time to apply them in a new context.    If you began this chapter feeling anxious about your readiness to integrate data science into your teaching, we hope you're ending it with a different perspective. You are not starting from zero—you're building on a foundation of sophisticated thinking skills and pedagogical expertise that translates beautifully to data science education.  Your background as an educator, not a data scientist, is actually an asset. You understand how students learn, you know how to create safe spaces for intellectual risk-taking, and you have experience guiding learners through complex thinking processes. These skills are exactly what K-12 data science education needs.  Most importantly, your willingness to learn alongside your students sends a powerful message about what it means to be a lifelong learner. In a world where information changes rapidly and new tools emerge constantly, the ability to approach unfamiliar territory with curiosity rather than fear is one of the most valuable gifts you can give your students.  As you move forward in this journey, remember that every expert was once a beginner, every confident teacher once felt uncertain, and every successful data science integration started with someone willing to take the first small step. You're ready for that step—and your students will be better learners because you're taking it alongside them.  In the next chapter, we'll explore specific, grade-level appropriate activities and tools that you can use to begin your data science integration. You'll see concrete examples of how other teachers have successfully connected data science thinking to their existing curriculum, giving you practical models to adapt for your own classroom.     Data Moves: Transforming Data for Analysis   When working with real-world datasets, we rarely find data in exactly the form we need for analysis. Raw data often requires manipulation, transformation, and restructuring to answer our questions effectively. In this chapter, we explore data moves — the fundamental actions that alter a dataset's contents, structure, or values to support meaningful investigation.  Data moves are essential skills that bridge the gap between having data and being able to use it effectively. They align with multiple strands of data science learning, including data creation and curation (Strand B), analysis techniques (Strand C), and preparation for visualization and communication (Strand E).   Learning Objectives:   By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:  Define data moves and explain their role in data analysis  Identify and apply the six core data moves: filtering, grouping, summarizing, calculating, merging, and making hierarchy  Transform datasets to support specific analytical goals  Recognize when different data moves are appropriate for given situations  Apply data moves using digital tools and understand their ethical implications      What Are Data Moves?  A data move is an action that alters a dataset's contents, structure, or values. Think of data moves as the essential toolkit for reshaping data to answer questions. Just as a carpenter uses different tools for different tasks, data analysts use different moves depending on their analytical goals.   Data Move   An action that alters a dataset's:  Contents : changing which cases (rows) or attributes (columns) are present  Structure : changing how cases, attributes, and values relate to each other  Values : changing the actual data values in cells       The Deck of Cards Metaphor  To understand data moves, imagine you have a deck of 800 cards, each representing a person from a health survey. Each card shows information like age, height, weight, and gender.  If you want to explore height differences among 12-year-olds by gender, you might:  Look through the deck to pick out all the 12-year-olds (filtering)  Separate the 12-year-olds into stacks by gender (grouping)  Calculate the average height for each stack (summarizing)    Each of these actions is a data move that transforms your data to help answer your question.   Data moves connect directly to several learning progression concepts:  Data Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Manipulating data through sorting, grouping, and filtering  Tool Application (C.4.1): Using digital tools to summarize and create visualizations  Organizing and Structure (B.1.2): Arranging data into structured formats using systematic methods      The Six Core Data Moves   Research has identified six fundamental data moves that appear consistently across data analysis contexts. These moves can be combined and applied in various orders to transform data for specific analytical purposes.    Filtering: Focusing Your Data   Filtering creates a subset of data by removing cases that don't meet specific criteria. Filtering serves two main purposes: scoping (removing irrelevant data) and slicing (reducing complexity to gain insight).   Temperature Data Filtering  Consider a dataset with 17,500 temperature measurements taken every 30 minutes throughout 2000. Plotting all data points shows a general relationship between air and soil temperature, but filtering to show only one day (May 19, 2000) reveals a clear diurnal pattern that was hidden in the full dataset.    Learning Progression Connections:   Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Filter data based on groups or subsets relevant to the problem  Identifying Patterns (C.2.3): Using filtering to reveal relationships and trends  Sense-making with Visualizations (E.1.1): Creating visualizations to summarize complex ideas     Filtering Practice   Using a dataset of student survey responses about technology use:  Filter to show only high school students  Filter to show only responses from the last month  Combine filters to show high school students from the last month who use social media daily  Discuss how each filter changes what patterns you can observe.      Grouping: Organizing for Comparison   Grouping divides a dataset into multiple subsets based on shared characteristics. While filtering restricts analysis to a single subset, grouping creates multiple subsets for comparison. Binning is a special type of grouping that uses ranges of continuous values.  Grouping is fundamental for making comparisons and is often a prerequisite for summarizing data. The way you define groups can dramatically affect what patterns emerge from your analysis.   Height Data Grouping  To create a histogram of height data, you group people into height ranges (bins). Choosing narrow bins (5 cm ranges) versus wide bins (20 cm ranges) will reveal very different patterns in the distribution.    Learning Progression Connections:   Frequency Tables (C.1.4): Organize data into frequency tables based on shared characteristics  Comparing Variables (C.2.1): Use reasoning about distributions to compare two groups  Summarizing Groups (B.1.4): Create summary measures for groups      Summarizing: Creating Aggregate Measures   Summarizing produces aggregate values that describe groups or entire datasets. While the mean is common, summary measures include any statistic that consolidates multiple values into a single measure: median, mode, standard deviation, counts, percentages, etc.  Summarizing often works together with grouping to create simpler displays that highlight overall patterns. However, this consolidation always involves information loss — when showing only measures of center, variability information disappears.   Height by Age and Gender  Starting with 800 individual height measurements, you can:  Group by age and gender (creating 30 groups)  Calculate mean height for each group (summarizing)  Create a graph with 30 points instead of 800, clearly showing growth patterns      Learning Progression Connections:   Measures of Center (C.1.1): Calculate summaries for categorical and numeric data  Measures of Spread (C.1.2): Calculate standard deviation and interquartile range  Understanding Distributions (C.2.2): Represent variability using numerical measures      Calculating: Creating New Attributes   Calculating creates new attributes (columns) using formulas applied to existing data. New attributes can be conceptual (like Body Mass Index combining height and weight) or convenience attributes (like converting units or creating categories).  Calculated attributes expand analytical possibilities by:  Combining multiple measurements into meaningful indices  Converting continuous variables into categories  Creating relative measures (percentages, ratios)  Standardizing units or formats     Body Mass Index Calculation  From height (cm) and weight (kg) measurements, calculate BMI:  BMI = (weight \/ height²) × 10000  This new attribute provides health professionals with a standardized measure that's more informative than weight alone.    Learning Progression Connections:   Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Use calculations and logic statements to create new attributes  Defining Relationships (C.2.3): Use data to create new groupings or construct new measures  Tool Application (C.4.1): Perform data analysis using digital tools      Merging and Joining: Combining Datasets   Merging and joining combine multiple datasets. Simple merging concatenates datasets about the same phenomenon from different sources. Joining adds new attributes about existing cases by connecting datasets through common identifiers.  Real-world data often comes in separate tables that must be connected. Health surveys, for example, might store demographic information separately from medical measurements, requiring joins to create complete analytical datasets.   Health Survey Data Joining  The NHANES health survey stores data in separate tables:  Demographics table : ID, Age, Gender  Measurements table : ID, Height, Weight, Blood Pressure  Using the ID field, you can join these tables to analyze relationships between demographic characteristics and health measurements.    Learning Progression Connections:   Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Use an identifying attribute to merge datasets  Complexity of Structure (B.4.4): Merge multiple datasets while maintaining appropriate case structure  Finding Secondary Data (B.2.4): Combine multiple secondary datasets to create comprehensive data      Making Hierarchy: Restructuring Data Relationships   Making hierarchy organizes data into nested levels where some cases become parents containing other child cases. This move is particularly powerful because it provides an elegant way to think about grouping and summarizing.  Hierarchical organization allows analysts to:  Manipulate dataset structure for specific purposes  Create summary measures as first-class variables  Work with naturally nested data (students within schools, individuals within households)  Build more sophisticated analytical models     Household Data Hierarchy  Census data includes both individual and household information. By creating a hierarchy with households as parents and individuals as children, you can:  Calculate household size (count of individuals per household)  Analyze relationships between household characteristics and individual outcomes  Compare household-level patterns across different regions      Learning Progression Connections:   Organizing and Structure (B.1.2): Create hierarchical data structures with multiple related tables  Understanding Modeling (C.5.1): Recognize that models simplify complex systems  Complexity of Structure (B.4.4): Design data structures for longitudinal data and multiple aggregation levels       Data Moves in Practice   Data moves rarely occur in isolation. Most analytical tasks require combining multiple moves in thoughtful sequences. The order and combination of moves depends on your data, your questions, and your analytical goals.   Complete Analysis: Student Performance by School Type  Suppose you want to investigate whether student performance differs between public and private schools:  Merging : Combine student test scores with school information datasets  Filtering : Remove students with missing test scores  Calculating : Create standardized test score measures  Grouping : Separate students by school type (public vs. private)  Summarizing : Calculate mean scores and standard deviations for each group  Making Hierarchy : Organize data with schools as parents and students as children to account for school-level effects       Choosing Appropriate Data Moves  Selecting the right data moves requires understanding both your data and your analytical goals. Consider these questions:  What question am I trying to answer?  What is the current structure of my data?  What structure do I need for my intended analysis or visualization?  What information might I lose through each transformation?  How do my moves affect the interpretation of results?     Learning Progression Connections:   Verifiable Questions (D.2.1): Differentiate query-based, hypothesis-based, and causal questions  Problem Identification (D.2.1): Construct data-based questions that explore relationships between variables  Iteration and Validation (D.2.2): Regularly practice identifying alternative explanations for results      Ethical Considerations in Data Moves  Data moves are not neutral — they involve choices that can reinforce or challenge existing biases. When transforming data, consider:  How do my grouping choices reflect or create social categories?  What voices or perspectives might be lost through filtering or summarizing?  How do calculated measures encode particular assumptions or values?  Who benefits from the insights enabled by these transformations?     Learning Progression Connections:   Biases in Data (A.2.2): Recognize how biases can obscure inferences drawn from data  Data Use Risks and Benefits (A.2.1): Analyze how data use can perpetuate biases or systemic inequities  Ethics of Data Collection (B.3.3): Design data collection methods that address privacy, consent, and fair representation       Digital Tools for Data Moves   Modern data analysis relies on digital tools that automate and scale data moves. Different tools offer different capabilities and require different levels of technical expertise.    Categories of Data Analysis Tools    No-code tools : Drag-and-drop interfaces (like CODAP, Tableau Public)  Low-code tools : Visual programming with some formula writing (like Excel, Google Sheets)  High-code tools : Programming languages (like R, Python, SQL)    The choice of tool depends on your data size, complexity, analytical needs, and technical skills. Learning data moves conceptually helps you transition between tools as your needs evolve.   Learning Progression Connections:   Tool Selection (C.4.4): Select appropriate no-code, low-code, or high-code tools based on task  Tool Evaluation (C.4.3): Assess technical limitations and compare different tool categories  The Role of Code (C.4.5): Recognize advantages and limitations of coding versus no-code tools      Reproducibility and Documentation  Good data analysis requires documenting your data moves so others (including your future self) can understand and reproduce your work. This includes:  Recording the sequence of moves applied  Explaining the reasoning behind each transformation  Preserving original data alongside transformed versions  Testing moves with subsets before applying to full datasets     Learning Progression Connections:   Meta-analysis and Facts (D.3.7): Document data analysis steps in shareable and reproducible format  Metadata (C.1.6): Apply understanding of metadata to summarize and analyze data       Beyond the Core Moves   As data science continues to evolve, additional data moves become important for specific applications. These specialized moves build on the core six but address particular analytical needs.    Data Cleaning Moves  Real-world data requires extensive cleaning before analysis:  Recoding : Standardizing category names or value formats  Missing value handling : Deciding how to treat incomplete data  Outlier management : Identifying and addressing extreme values  Format conversion : Changing data types or structures     Learning Progression Connections:   Data Cleaning (B.1.1): Apply comprehensive data validation procedures including automated checks  Cleanliness (B.4.1): Work with datasets requiring multiple types of cleaning  Missing data (C.1.5): Adjust analyses in light of missing values      Advanced Analytical Moves  Sophisticated analyses may require additional moves:  Sampling : Creating representative subsets for analysis or validation  Pivoting : Converting between wide and long data formats  Time series operations : Handling temporal data and trends  Text processing : Extracting structured information from unstructured text     Learning Progression Connections:   Analyzing Non-traditional Data (C.2.4): Generate word clouds after standardizing and removing stop words  Machine Learning (C.2.5): Use data to build decision trees and explore classification  Sampling and Simulation (D.1.5): Use simulation-based inferential methods to draw conclusions       Chapter Exercises   Identifying Data Moves   For each scenario below, identify which data move(s) would be most appropriate and explain your reasoning:  You have temperature data from 50 weather stations, but you only want to analyze data from coastal locations.  You want to compare average rainfall between northern and southern regions of your state.  You have separate datasets for student demographics and test scores, both containing student ID numbers.  You want to create age categories (child, teen, adult, senior) from a dataset with exact birth dates.  You want to analyze how household income relates to individual education levels using census data.       Sequencing Data Moves   Design a sequence of data moves to answer this question: Do students at larger schools perform better on standardized tests than students at smaller schools? Available data:  Student test scores with student IDs  School enrollment data with school IDs  Student-school assignments linking student IDs to school IDs  For each move in your sequence, explain:  Which specific data move you're applying  Why this move is necessary  How it prepares the data for subsequent steps       Ethical Analysis of Data Moves   Consider a dataset about job applications that includes information about applicant names, education, experience, and hiring decisions. You want to analyze whether there are differences in hiring rates across different groups.  What data moves would you need to perform this analysis?  What ethical considerations arise from each move?  How might your choices in performing these moves affect your conclusions?  What steps could you take to ensure your analysis is fair and transparent?       Complete Data Analysis Project   Choose a publicly available dataset relevant to your classroom and what your students' interests are (suggestions: sports, social media, education, health, environment, economics). Conduct a complete analysis that demonstrates all six core data moves and think about how you can not only teach these steps to your students (depending on age), but also how you can now use this dataset in your classroom going forward to achieve some of your learning objectives.  Your analysis should include:  Plan: Formulate a clear research question  Document: Keep a log of every data move you perform  Implement: Apply filtering, grouping, summarizing, calculating, merging (if applicable), and hierarchy creation  Reflect: Analyze how each move contributed to answering your question  Communicate: Present your findings with clear visualizations and explanations        Chapter Summary  Data moves are the fundamental building blocks of data analysis, providing the tools to transform raw data into forms that support meaningful investigation. The six core moves — filtering, grouping, summarizing, calculating, merging, and making hierarchy — can be combined in countless ways to address diverse analytical questions.  Mastering data moves requires both technical skills and conceptual understanding. You need to know not just how to perform these transformations, but when to use them, how they affect your data, and what ethical considerations they raise. This understanding becomes increasingly important as data plays a larger role in society and decision-making.  The learning progressions provide a roadmap for developing these skills across educational levels, from basic sorting and counting in elementary grades to sophisticated analytical techniques in advanced courses. By grounding data moves in this developmental framework, we can build students' capacity to engage critically and creatively with data throughout their lives.  As you continue your data science journey, remember that data moves are means to an end — they help you explore questions, test hypotheses, and communicate insights. The most important skill is learning to ask good questions and then selecting and sequencing data moves to help answer them in ways that are accurate, ethical, and meaningful.

This is especially important in data science, where the process of investigation often involves false starts and course corrections.     Think about a time when you learned something new as an adult (this could be a hobby, a technology skill, a new teaching strategy, etc.). Describe the process: What did you try first? What didn't work? How did you adjust your approach? What finally helped it \"click\"?    How could you share this learning story with your students in a way that helps them understand that struggle and revision are normal parts of learning? What specific message would you want them to take away?    Think of an upcoming lesson or activity where students might struggle or make mistakes. How could you frame this as \"productive struggle\" rather than failure? What language could you use to normalize the process of trying, adjusting, and trying again?    How might you make your own learning process visible to students when you try data science activities together? What would it look like to genuinely learn alongside them rather than pretending to already know everything?      "

Data Collection: Think about information you currently gather or present to students (attendance patterns, weather data for science, historical statistics, survey results, etc.). How could you have students collect this data themselves instead of you providing it? What would they learn from the collection process?     Pattern Recognition: Consider a lesson where you typically point out patterns or trends to students. How could you instead present the data and ask students to identify the patterns themselves? What questions could you ask to guide their analysis?     Making Comparisons: Think about times when you compare different options, time periods, locations, or approaches in your teaching. How could students collect and compare this data themselves? What tools could they use to organize and present their comparisons?     Classroom Management Data: What classroom routines or procedures could students help track and analyze? (Examples: time spent on different activities, participation patterns, effectiveness of different classroom arrangements, etc.) How might involving them in this analysis improve both their data skills and your classroom community?     Assessment and Reflection: How could students participate more actively in tracking and analyzing their own learning progress? What data could they collect about their own growth, challenges, or learning strategies?      "

One Connection to Celebrate: Choose one connection between data science and your existing skills that most resonates with you. How will you remind yourself of this connection when you feel uncertain about trying data science activities?     One Low-Stakes Experiment: From your reflections above, choose one small change you could make in the next two weeks—something where you let students take on more of the data work. Be specific about what you'll try and when.     Learning Mindset Goal: How will you model the learning process for your students when you try this experiment? What will you say or do to show them that learning involves iteration and that mistakes are valuable?     Support System: Who could you share your data science learning journey with? This might be a colleague, a professional learning community, or even your students themselves. How could they support you as you try new approaches?     Reflection Plan: How will you track what you learn from this experience? What questions will you ask yourself after trying your low-stakes experiment? How will you use what you learn to plan your next step?      "
