  <title>Grades 3-5 Subject Integration Playbook: Data Science Across the Curriculum</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Your 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders are ready for sophisticated data science investigations that span multiple days, involve real-world complexity, and connect meaningfully across subject areas. They can handle messier data, design their own studies, and tackle questions that matter to them and their community.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This chapter will show you how to leverage their growing independence, collaborative skills, and systematic thinking to create powerful learning experiences that enhance every subject you teach. You'll discover how data science can make your curriculum more engaging, relevant, and connected while building the critical thinking skills students need for middle school and beyond.

    <p>
      You now have a comprehensive toolkit for creating sophisticated, multi-subject data science investigations that challenge and engage your intermediate elementary students. You've seen how data science can deepen understanding in every subject while building critical thinking skills that transfer across disciplines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that the goal is authentic investigation that serves real learning purposes across multiple subjects. Your students are capable of handling complexity, collaborating effectively, and producing work that makes genuine contributions to their school and community.

      <title>Reflection: Your Advanced Integration Plan</title>
      <p>
        Before moving to the next chapter, take a moment to plan:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Which multi-subject investigation feels most doable for your context?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. How will you balance structure with student choice in your integrated projects?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. What support do you need for managing complex, multi-day investigations?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. How will you assess learning across multiple subjects simultaneously?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. What partnerships could enhance your students' investigations (local experts, community organizations, other classes)?
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      In the next chapter, we'll explore practical classroom implementation strategies specifically designed for intermediate elementary learners, including project management techniques, collaborative learning structures, and authentic assessment approaches that support both subject-area learning and data science skill development.
