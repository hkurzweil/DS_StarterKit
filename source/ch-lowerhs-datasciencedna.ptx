  <title>Grades 9-10 Data Science DNA: The Launch Years</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Welcome to high school data science - where students are ready to engage with the discipline as emerging practitioners! Your 9th and 10th graders are at a pivotal moment: they're developing their academic identities, thinking about future pathways, and capable of sophisticated research that mirrors professional data science work.

        There are several misconceptions about high school students' data science capabilities and needs. Let's address these to ensure you can fully leverage their sophisticated potential.

        2. Which of the seven advanced concepts feels most important for preparing students for their futures?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. What real-world problems could your students investigate that would genuinely contribute to knowledge or policy?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. How comfortable are you with shifting from teacher to mentor role?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. What support would help you feel more confident facilitating professional-level research experiences?
