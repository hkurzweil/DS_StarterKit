  <title>Grades 3-5 Assessment &amp; Growth Monitoring: Building Data Science Confidence and Skills</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Assessment in intermediate elementary focuses on observing how students apply data science concepts to real questions while developing independence and confidence. Your goal is to track growth in statistical reasoning, data communication, and problem-solving while maintaining assessment practices that enhance rather than interrupt learning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This chapter provides practical tools for assessing data science development as students transition from concrete manipulatives to more abstract thinking. All strategies are designed to provide meaningful information about student progress while remaining manageable within your existing classroom routines.

    <title>Assessment Wrap-Up: Supporting Data Science Growth and Transition</title>
    
    <p>
      Assessment in grades 3-5 bridges the concrete thinking of early elementary with the abstract reasoning required in middle school. Focus on building student confidence and independence while ensuring solid foundations in statistical thinking and data science processes.
    </p>

    <note xml:id="final-assessment-reflection-3-5">
      <title>Final Reflection: Your 3-5 Assessment Practice</title>
      <p>
        As you implement these assessment strategies, remember:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Balance structure with flexibility - students need guidance but also opportunities for independent thinking
      </p>
      <p>
        • Emphasize process over product - how students think about data is as important as their final answers
      </p>
      <p>
        • Build on student interests - use topics and contexts that engage and motivate learners
      </p>
      <p>
        • Support risk-taking - encourage students to ask challenging questions and explore complex ideas
      </p>
      <p>
        • Connect to real world - help students see the relevance of data science to their lives and community
      </p>
      <p>
        • Prepare for transition - ensure students are ready for the increased independence of middle school
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      Your assessment practices in grades 3-5 are crucial for building the confidence and skills students need for middle school data science success. By combining systematic skill development with authentic, engaging contexts, you help students see themselves as capable data scientists ready to tackle increasingly complex questions and challenges.
