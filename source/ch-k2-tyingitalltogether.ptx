      <title>Case Study 1: "What's Our Class's Favorite?" - Student Interest Survey Project</title>
      
      <p>
        <alert>Teacher Background:</alert> Sarah teaches a combined K-1 classroom of 22 students in a suburban elementary school. She wanted to help her students get to know each other while building foundational data concepts.

        <title>The Favorite Things Investigation</title>
        <p>
          <alert>The Project Overview:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Over two weeks, Sarah's students investigated the question: "What are our class's favorite things?" The project integrated naturally with their social studies unit on community and friendship while building mathematical thinking and communication skills.

        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: A.3.1 The investigative process</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "I started by asking my students what they were curious about," Sarah explains. "They wanted to know things like 'What's everyone's favorite color?' and 'What pets do we have?' This natural curiosity is exactly what A.3.1 describes—recognizing there's an investigative process for exploring questions about the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          The students brainstormed questions they could ask their classmates:
        </p>
        <p>
          • What's your favorite color?
        </p>
        <p>
          • What's your favorite animal?
        </p>
        <p>
          • What's your favorite snack?
        </p>
        <p>
          • How many people live in your house?
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.2.1 Designing data-based investigations</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "We talked about which questions we could answer by asking our friends," Sarah notes. "This connects to B.2.1 because even young children can formulate simple questions that guide data collection about familiar contexts. They understood that some questions (like 'Are unicorns real?') couldn't be answered by surveying our class, but others (like favorite colors) could."
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Data Collection Process:</alert>

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: B.3.1 Creating your own data</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day, students asked one question during morning meeting. Sarah created simple picture cards to help non-readers participate. "B.3.1 emphasizes that data is information collected and recorded with a purpose," she explains. "My students understood they were collecting information to learn about their classmates."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students used clipboards to record their classmates' answers, with older kindergarteners helping pre-readers. This built both data collection skills and classroom community.

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: A.1.1 Data types and forms</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "When we looked at our answers, students naturally noticed that some data was about colors and words (categorical data) while other data was about numbers (numerical data)," Sarah observes. "A.1.1 talks about recognizing that data can exist as quantitative, categorical, and other values—and my students could see the difference even without using those formal terms."
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: C.1.4 Frequency tables</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Students organized their data by sorting response cards into groups. "This is exactly what C.1.4 describes—sorting objects into a frequency table based on shared characteristics," Sarah explains. "We counted how many students chose each answer and made simple charts."
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: E.1.1 Sense-making with visualizations</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          The class created picture graphs using stickers and poster paper. "E.1.1 focuses on creating data visualizations to represent an aspect of student's daily life," Sarah notes. "Our graphs showed information about ourselves—perfect for this age group."
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: E.2.1 Connect narratives and data visualizations</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Students shared their findings during show-and-tell, explaining what their graphs showed about the class. "E.2.1 describes understanding how visualizations can tell a story about ourselves," Sarah explains. "My students could look at our favorite color graph and say, 'Most of our class likes blue!' They were connecting the visual to a story about who we are."

          <alert>The Project Overview:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Marcus integrated data science thinking into a three-week exploration that connected math (geometry and measurement), science (classification and properties), and literacy (descriptive language and communication).

        </p>
        <p>
          "We started by exploring the manipulatives in our math center," Marcus explains. "Students naturally began sorting blocks by color, shape, and size. This connects directly to A.1.1—recognizing that data can exist as categorical values like color and shape, and quantitative values like the number of sides or the height of blocks."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students worked in small groups to sort collections of classroom objects:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Pattern blocks (color, shape, number of sides)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Counting bears (color, size)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Buttons (color, number of holes, size)
        </p>

          <alert>Learning Progression Connection: C.2.3 Defining relationships</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          "As students sorted, they began noticing patterns," Marcus notes. "They discovered that all the red pattern blocks were the same shape, or that bigger books often had more pages. C.2.3 describes organizing objects by size, color, shape, etc.—exactly what my students were doing naturally."

          Students chose one collection to investigate more systematically. "B.3.1 emphasizes understanding that a variable measures the same characteristic on several objects," Marcus explains. "We talked about how 'color' was something we could observe and record for every button in our collection."
        </p>
        <p>
          Each group created simple data collection sheets:
        </p>

          • Drew pictures of each object they were studying
        </p>
        <p>

          <alert>The Project Overview:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Jasmine integrated data science thinking into a month-long celebration of reading that helped students track their progress, explore story patterns, and build excitement about books while developing foundational data concepts.

        </p>
        <p>
          "We started by looking at the books in our classroom library," Jasmine explains. "Students noticed that books had different characteristics—some were about animals, some about families, some were fiction, some were facts. This connects to A.1.1—recognizing that data can exist as categorical values like book topics and story types."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students explored questions about their books:
        </p>
        <p>
          • What kinds of stories do we have in our library?
        </p>
        <p>
          • What topics appear most often in our books?
        </p>
        <p>
          • Are most of our books fiction or nonfiction?

          Students began tracking their daily reading using simple charts. "A.3.1 describes recognizing there's an investigative process for exploring questions," Jasmine explains. "My students were investigating questions about their own reading habits and growth."
        </p>
        <p>
          Each student had a personal reading tracker:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Books read each day (with pictures for non-readers)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Types of books (animal stories, family stories, alphabet books)
        </p>
        <p>
          • Reading with others vs. reading alone
        </p>
        <p>
          • How they felt about each book (happy face, sad face, excited face)

          "Students began noticing patterns in the stories they loved," Jasmine observes. "C.2.3 describes organizing and analyzing data to identify patterns. My students discovered that many of their favorite books had animals as main characters, or that they preferred books with happy endings."
        </p>
        <p>
          Students explored story patterns:
        </p>
        <p>
          • Characters: people, animals, or fantasy creatures
        </p>
        <p>
          • Settings: home, school, forest, magical places
        </p>
        <p>
          • Story problems: getting lost, making friends, learning something new

          Students created a large classroom display showing their reading data. "E.1.1 focuses on creating visualizations to represent aspects of students' daily lives," Jasmine explains. "Our reading display showed how much we'd read, what kinds of books we loved, and how our reading skills were growing."
        </p>
        <p>
          The class display included:
        </p>
        <p>

        <title>Why Reading and Data Science Work So Well Together</title>
        <p>
          Both reading and data science involve making meaning from information, recognizing patterns, and drawing conclusions. When students track their reading data, they develop metacognitive awareness of their learning while building both literacy and analytical thinking skills simultaneously.

          "Once I stopped worrying about the formal language and focused on the actual thinking skills, I realized my students were already doing many of these things naturally. I just needed to name what they were doing and be more intentional about it."

    <title>Stories Wrap-Up: Making Data Science Natural for Young Learners</title>
    
    <p>
      These real classroom stories demonstrate that data science isn't something added on top of K-2 curriculum—it's a natural way of thinking that enhances learning across all subject areas. When young students sort, count, observe patterns, and share their discoveries, they're developing foundational skills that will serve them throughout their educational journey.
    </p>

    <note xml:id="final-stories-reflection-k2">
      <title>Key Takeaways from K-2 Implementation</title>
      <p>
        • <alert>Start with curiosity:</alert> Young children are naturally curious about their world—data science builds on this natural inclination
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Keep it concrete:</alert> Use real objects, familiar topics, and hands-on activities rather than abstract concepts
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Integrate naturally:</alert> Look for connections with existing curriculum rather than adding new requirements
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Celebrate discoveries:</alert> When students notice patterns or make connections, name and celebrate their data science thinking
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Build gradually:</alert> Start simple and add complexity as students show readiness and interest
      </p>
      <p>
        • <alert>Focus on thinking:</alert> The goal is developing data science thinking habits, not mastering specific tools or techniques
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      Remember that every classroom is different, and these examples are meant to inspire your own creative adaptations. The template and customization options provide starting points for developing data science experiences that fit your students, your curriculum, and your teaching style.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most importantly, trust your students' natural curiosity and your own professional judgment. When you create opportunities for young learners to ask questions, collect information, notice patterns, and share their discoveries, you're building the foundation for a lifetime of data-informed thinking and decision-making.
