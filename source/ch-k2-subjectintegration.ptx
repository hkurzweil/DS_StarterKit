  <title>K-2 Subject Integration Playbook: Data Science Across the Curriculum</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Data science isn't another subject to add to your already packed K-2 day. Instead, it's a way of thinking that naturally enhances every subject you're already teaching. Young children are constantly collecting information, organizing what they find, and sharing their discoveries - which means data science thinking is already happening in your classroom!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This chapter will show you specific, practical ways to bring out the data science thinking that's already embedded in your reading, math, science, social studies, and arts instruction. You'll discover that you don't need new curriculum - you need new eyes to see the data science potential in what you're already doing.
    </p>

          Begin with tiny moments that feel natural. As you and your students get comfortable with data science thinking, you can gradually add more sophisticated investigations. The goal is to build habits of thinking, not to create elaborate projects.

    <title>Chapter Wrap-Up: Your K-2 Integration Toolkit</title>
    
    <p>
      You now have a comprehensive toolkit for integrating data science thinking across every subject in your K-2 classroom. You've seen that data science doesn't compete with other subjects - it enhances them by adding purpose, engagement, and real-world connections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that the goal isn't to dramatically change what you're teaching, but to bring out the data science thinking that's already naturally present in young children's learning. Start small, build gradually, and celebrate the moments when students naturally ask questions, sort information, or share discoveries.
    </p>

    <note xml:id="final-reflection-integrationk2">
      <title>Reflection: Your Integration Plan</title>
      <p>
        Before moving to the next chapter, take a moment to plan:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Which subject area feels most natural for starting data science integration?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. What's one small change you could make to a lesson this week?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. How will you help students see connections between subjects through data?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. What support do you need to feel confident with integration?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. How will you know if the integration is working for your students?
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      In the next chapter, we'll dive into practical classroom implementation strategies, including lesson planning templates, activity structures, and day-to-day management techniques that make data science integration smooth and sustainable in your K-2 classroom.
