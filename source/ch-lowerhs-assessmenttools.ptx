  <title>Grades 9-10 Assessment &amp; Growth Monitoring: Professional-Level Research Evaluation</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Assessment in grades 9-10 mirrors professional research environments where students conduct work worthy of publication and presentation at academic conferences. Your role shifts from traditional teacher to research supervisor, using assessment methods similar to those in graduate programs and professional research settings.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This chapter provides assessment frameworks that maintain academic rigor while recognizing that students are still developing researchers. Focus on authentic professional evaluation while providing appropriate scaffolding and support for continued growth.
