    <title>Assessment Wrap-Up: Graduating Engaged Data Citizens</title>
    
    <p>
      Assessment in grades 11-12 represents the culmination of K-12 data science education with a focus on civic engagement and social responsibility. The goal is to graduate students who will use their data science skills throughout their lives to contribute to their communities and democratic society.
    </p>

    <note xml:id="final-assessment-reflection-11-12">
      <title>Final Reflection: Your 11-12 Civic Engagement Assessment Practice</title>
      <p>
        As you implement these civic-focused assessment strategies, remember:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Balance rigor with relevance - maintain high academic standards while emphasizing real-world application
      </p>
      <p>
        • Foster civic commitment - help students see data science as a tool for democratic participation and social good
      </p>
      <p>
        • Build authentic partnerships - create genuine relationships with community organizations and stakeholders
      </p>
      <p>
        • Prepare for transition - ensure students are ready for college success and lifelong civic engagement
      </p>
      <p>
        • Measure real impact - assess both student learning and actual community benefit from projects
      </p>
      <p>
        • Celebrate citizenship - recognize the significance of preparing engaged, thoughtful citizens
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      Your assessment practices in grades 11-12 prepare students not just for academic and professional success, but for a lifetime of engaged citizenship and social contribution. By maintaining high expectations while emphasizing civic engagement and social responsibility, you help students understand that data science skills come with both opportunities and obligations to serve the common good.
    </p>

    <p>
      The complete K-12 assessment progression now shows a clear trajectory from simple observation and celebration in early grades to sophisticated civic engagement and professional preparation in the senior year. Each grade band builds systematically toward the ultimate goal: graduating thoughtful, skilled, and engaged citizens who will use data science to make the world a better place.
