    <title>Chapter Wrap-Up: Your Advanced Data Science Foundation</title>
    
    <p>
      You now understand what makes advanced high school students capable of sophisticated, professional-level data science work. You know the eight capstone concepts they're ready to master, the misconceptions to avoid, and how to mentor and assess work that meets professional standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most importantly, you've seen that your 11-12 students are ready to be producers of knowledge, leaders in their communities, and emerging professionals who can tackle the most complex challenges facing our world. Your role is to provide mentorship and guidance while respecting their capabilities and supporting their development as future leaders.
    </p>

      <title>Reflection: Your Advanced Data Science Vision</title>
      <p>
        Before moving to the next chapter, take a moment to reflect:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. What excites you most about the professional potential of advanced high school students?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Which of the eight capstone concepts feels most important for preparing students to be future leaders?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. What original research could your students conduct that would genuinely contribute to important questions?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. How comfortable are you with shifting from teacher to colleague/mentor relationships?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. What support would help you feel more confident mentoring professional-level research and development?
      </p>
    </note>

    <p>
      In the next chapter, we'll explore specific ways to integrate these advanced data science concepts across your curriculum, with practical examples and strategies that leverage the leadership, expertise, and professional aspirations that make advanced high school students such remarkable learners and contributors.
