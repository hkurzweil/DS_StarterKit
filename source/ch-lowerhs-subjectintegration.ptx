      <title>Reflection: Your Professional-Level Student Research Program</title>
      <p>
        Before moving to the next chapter, consider these questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. What industry professionals could you connect with to mentor student research?
      </p>
      <p>
        2. How will you support students in maintaining professional standards while honoring their independence?
      </p>
      <p>
        3. What publication and presentation opportunities exist for student work in your area?
      </p>
      <p>
        4. How can you help students balance sophisticated research with college preparation requirements?
      </p>
      <p>
        5. What partnerships with universities or research institutions could enhance student opportunities?
