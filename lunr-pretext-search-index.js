  "title": "What is Data Science?",
  "body": " What is Data Science?  Data science is the art and science of extracting meaningful insights from data to solve real-world problems. At its core, data science combines three essential elements: domain expertise (knowing about the subject area), mathematical and statistical skills, and computational thinking. Think of it as detective work—data scientists ask questions, gather evidence (data), analyze patterns, and draw conclusions that can inform decisions and actions.  But data science isn't just about numbers and computers. It's fundamentally about curiosity, critical thinking, and communication. Data scientists must ask good questions, think creatively about how to find answers, and then share their findings in ways that others can understand and act upon. These are skills that align perfectly with what we want to develop in our students across all subject areas.  The data science process typically follows a cycle: we start with a question or problem, collect and organize relevant data, explore and analyze that data to find patterns, create models or visualizations to represent our findings, and then communicate our results to others. This cycle mirrors the scientific method and inquiry-based learning that many educators already use in their classrooms.  What makes data science particularly powerful in education is its interdisciplinary nature. Data science problems often require knowledge from multiple fields—science, mathematics, social studies, language arts, and more. This makes it an excellent vehicle for integrated learning and helps students see connections across different areas of knowledge.  "

  "title": "Data Science in K-12 Education",
  "body": " Data Science in K-12 Education  Data science in K-12 education isn't about turning elementary students into professional data analysts. Instead, it's about developing data literacy—the ability to read, work with, analyze, and communicate with data. Just as we teach students to be literate with text, we need to help them become literate with data, which is increasingly the language through which our world communicates.  In the K-12 context, data science education focuses on building foundational skills that students will use throughout their lives. These include asking investigative questions, collecting and organizing information, identifying patterns and trends, making evidence-based arguments, and communicating findings clearly. These skills develop progressively from elementary through high school, with activities appropriate for each developmental stage.  Data science education also emphasizes real-world relevance and student agency. Students work with data about topics they care about—from their local community to global issues—and use their findings to take action or make recommendations. This approach helps students see themselves as capable of understanding and influencing the world around them through data-driven inquiry.  Perhaps most importantly, K-12 data science education includes a strong focus on ethics and responsible data use. Students learn to question data sources, consider bias and fairness, protect privacy, and think critically about how data is collected and used. In our digital age, these skills are essential for informed citizenship and personal well-being.  The integration of data science in K-12 doesn't require completely restructuring your curriculum. Instead, it often involves enhancing existing activities with data science thinking—asking students to collect data about their science experiments, analyze historical trends in social studies, or explore patterns in literature. It's about cultivating a mindset of inquiry and evidence-based reasoning across all subjects.  "

  "body": " Applications to Your Teaching Practice  Now that you've reflected on data science and your current practice, it's time to think about concrete next steps. The goal isn't to completely transform your teaching overnight, but to identify small, manageable ways to begin incorporating data science thinking into your classroom.   Identifying Quick Wins   Quick wins are small changes that can have a big impact. These are low-risk ways to begin integrating data science thinking without requiring major curriculum overhauls or new technology.     Think of an upcoming lesson or unit. How could you add a simple data collection or analysis component? For example, students could survey classmates, measure objects, count occurrences, or research statistics online.    What's one question you could pose to your students that would require them to gather evidence or data to answer? How would they share their findings?    How could you incorporate more \"why\" and \"what if\" questions into your teaching? These questions often lead naturally to data investigations.        Making Cross-Curricular Connections   Data science thrives on interdisciplinary connections. Consider how you might connect different subject areas through data-focused investigations.     If you teach multiple subjects, identify a topic or theme that appears in more than one area. How could students use data to explore this topic from multiple perspectives?    If you teach a single subject, think about connections to other disciplines. How does your subject area connect to science, social studies, mathematics, or language arts through data?    How could you collaborate with colleagues in other subject areas to create a shared data science investigation?        Creating Your Action Plan   Based on your reflections in this chapter, create a concrete action plan for incorporating data science thinking into your practice.      This week: What's one small step you'll take this week to begin integrating data science thinking? Be specific about what you'll do and when.     This month: What's a slightly larger goal you'd like to accomplish within the next month? This might involve planning a lesson, trying a new activity, or having a conversation with a colleague.     This semester\/year: What's your bigger vision for incorporating data science in your teaching? What would success look like for you and your students?     Support needed: What resources, training, or support would help you achieve these goals? How might you access this support?       Remember, integrating data science into your teaching is a journey, not a destination. Start small, experiment, and learn alongside your students. The most important step is the first one—and you've already taken it by engaging with this chapter and reflecting on your practice.  "

  "title": "The Five Strands of Data Science Learning",
  "body": " The Five Strands of Data Science Learning   Strand A: Data Literacy and Responsibility   Focus: This strand establishes the foundational understanding of what data is and how it should be approached responsibly. It emphasizes that data is created by people, contains inherent variability, and provides only partial information about the world.   Why It Matters: In our data-driven society, students need to understand not just how to work with data, but what data represents and the ethical considerations involved in its collection and use. This strand develops critical thinking about data sources, biases, and the power dynamics involved in data work. Students learn to approach data with both curiosity and healthy skepticism.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students begin by recognizing that data can answer questions and that there are different types of information we can collect   3-5: Students understand that data is created by people making decisions about what to measure and how   6-8: Students recognize limitations in data and begin to identify bias and ethical considerations   9-10: Students analyze how data collection methods affect interpretation and develop strategies for responsible data use   11-12: Students critically evaluate data sources, understand complex ethical implications, and take agency in their own data practices    Strand B: Creation and Curation   Focus: This strand covers where data comes from and how it should be collected, organized, and formatted to be useful. It encompasses both creating new data and working with existing datasets, emphasizing that real-world data is often messy and requires careful curation.   Why It Matters: Students need to understand that high-quality analysis begins with high-quality data. This strand teaches students to be thoughtful about data collection methods, to recognize and address data quality issues, and to organize data in ways that facilitate meaningful analysis. These skills are essential for both consuming and producing reliable data-based conclusions.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students collect and organize simple data using basic tools like counting and sorting   3-5: Students design simple investigations and organize data in tables with multiple attributes   6-8: Students learn to clean data, identify errors and missing values, and work with more complex data structures   9-10: Students design sophisticated data collection methods, work with multiple datasets, and understand sampling and bias   11-12: Students develop comprehensive data management systems and work with complex, real-world datasets requiring advanced cleaning and organization    Strand C: Analysis and Modeling Techniques   Focus: This strand develops students' ability to analyze data using various techniques, from basic summary statistics to complex modeling approaches. It emphasizes understanding which techniques to use for different types of data and questions, and includes both traditional statistical methods and modern computational approaches.   Why It Matters: Analysis transforms raw data into insights. This strand ensures students can move beyond simply describing data to identifying patterns, relationships, and trends that inform decision-making. As data becomes increasingly complex and abundant, students need both conceptual understanding and practical skills with digital tools.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students describe data using simple comparisons and identify basic patterns through sorting and grouping   3-5: Students calculate simple summary statistics and use digital tools to create basic visualizations   6-8: Students work with measures of center and spread, identify relationships between variables, and begin using advanced digital tools   9-10: Students conduct statistical analyses, work with correlation and regression, and use simulation methods   11-12: Students apply advanced statistical techniques, work with machine learning concepts, and create sophisticated models    Strand D: Interpreting Problems and Results   Focus: This strand focuses on making and justifying claims from data within appropriate contexts. It emphasizes understanding the relationship between questions, data, and valid conclusions, including the limitations of what can be inferred from any dataset.   Why It Matters: The ability to draw valid conclusions from data is perhaps the most important skill in our information-rich world. This strand teaches students to think probabilistically, understand uncertainty, and communicate findings appropriately. It also develops skills in identifying when data supports or contradicts claims made by others.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students make simple claims based on data and recognize that different conclusions might be drawn from the same information   3-5: Students begin using probabilistic language and understand that conclusions should be supported by evidence   6-8: Students learn to qualify their conclusions with appropriate uncertainty language and recognize correlation versus causation   9-10: Students apply formal statistical concepts, understand sampling and generalization, and evaluate the strength of evidence   11-12: Students use advanced statistical inference, understand complex experimental design, and critically evaluate claims in media and research    Strand E: Visualization and Communication   Focus: This strand develops students' ability to create effective visualizations and communicate findings to different audiences. It encompasses both the technical skills of creating graphs and charts and the communication skills needed to tell compelling, accurate stories with data.   Why It Matters: Data visualization is both a tool for analysis and a medium for communication. Students need to understand how different visual representations highlight different aspects of data, and how to choose appropriate formats for their audiences and purposes. In a world filled with data visualizations, students also need to be critical consumers who can identify misleading or inappropriate visual representations.   Key Progressive Elements:    K-2: Students create simple visual representations like pictographs and bar charts using hands-on materials   3-5: Students use digital tools to create basic visualizations and begin connecting visuals to narratives   6-8: Students create more complex visualizations, understand design principles, and adapt their communication for different audiences   9-10: Students create sophisticated multi-variable visualizations, understand advanced design principles, and use data for advocacy   11-12: Students create publication-quality visualizations, understand accessibility considerations, and communicate complex analyses to diverse audiences   "

  "title": "Reframing What \"Expertise\" Means",
  "body": " Reframing What \"Expertise\" Means  One of the biggest barriers to integrating data science in K-12 education is the misconception that teachers need to be experts before they can guide students. This thinking comes from traditional models where teachers were expected to know everything before presenting it to students. But data science education—and modern pedagogy in general—works differently.  In data science, the most valuable skill isn't knowing all the answers; it's knowing how to ask good questions and how to find reliable ways to explore those questions. As a teacher, you've been doing this your entire career. Every time you help a student work through a problem, every time you design a lesson that builds on prior knowledge, every time you assess student understanding and adjust your instruction—you're demonstrating the core thinking processes of data science.  Consider this: when students struggle with a concept, do you immediately give them the answer, or do you guide them through questions that help them discover the solution themselves? The latter approach is exactly what data scientists do when faced with a new problem. They don't panic about not knowing the answer—they get curious about how to find it.  Your role in data science education isn't to be the expert who has all the answers. Your role is to be the expert facilitator who knows how to create conditions for learning, how to ask questions that spark curiosity, and how to support students as they develop their own understanding. These are skills you already have in abundance.  "

  "body": " The Data Science Skills You're Already Using  Every day in your classroom, you engage in sophisticated data analysis without even realizing it. When you look at assessment results and notice that several students missed the same type of problem, you're identifying patterns in data. When you track student progress over time and adjust your instruction based on what you see, you're using data to make informed decisions. When you help students make connections between different concepts or subjects, you're teaching them to synthesize information from multiple sources.  Think about how you analyze your students' learning. You don't just look at test scores—you observe behaviors, listen to discussions, review work samples, and consider individual circumstances. You're constantly collecting multiple types of data, looking for patterns, and drawing conclusions that inform your next steps. This is exactly what data scientists do in their work.  When you help students make sense of a story, you guide them to identify key information, recognize patterns in character development or plot structure, and draw conclusions based on evidence from the text. When you facilitate a discussion about historical events, you're helping students analyze multiple sources, consider different perspectives, and form evidence-based opinions. These are fundamental data science skills applied in language arts and social studies contexts.  Even your approach to classroom management involves data science thinking. You notice which strategies work with different students, you track patterns in behavior over time, and you adjust your approach based on evidence of what's most effective. You're already a practicing data scientist—you just haven't been calling it that.  "

  "title": "The Power of Learning Alongside Your Students",
  "body": " The Power of Learning Alongside Your Students  Here's a secret that might surprise you: some of the most effective data science teachers are those who don't come from technical backgrounds. Why? Because they understand something crucial about learning—it's okay not to know everything, and there's tremendous power in discovering things together.  When you approach data science as a co-learner with your students, you model something incredibly valuable: that learning is a lifelong process, that making mistakes is part of learning, and that curiosity is more important than having all the answers. Students who see their teacher genuinely engaged in learning are more likely to take intellectual risks themselves.  Think about the most memorable learning experiences you've had as an adult. Chances are, they involved some struggle, some uncertainty, and some breakthrough moments where things finally clicked. When you allow your students to see this process in action, you're teaching them that learning isn't about being perfect—it's about being persistent, curious, and willing to revise your thinking based on new evidence.  Your willingness to say \"I don't know, but let's figure it out together\" is actually a superpower in data science education. It creates an environment where students feel safe to explore, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes. It shifts the classroom dynamic from \"teacher as information deliverer\" to \"classroom as learning community,\" which is exactly the kind of environment where data science thinking thrives.  "

  "title": "Starting Small and Building Confidence",
  "body": " Starting Small and Building Confidence  The key to successfully integrating data science into your teaching isn't to completely overhaul your curriculum overnight. Instead, it's about starting with small modifications to things you're already doing well. Every successful data science integration began with a teacher who decided to try one small thing differently.  Maybe it's asking students to collect data about something they're curious about instead of just researching facts online. Maybe it's having students create a simple chart or graph to represent information they've gathered instead of just writing a paragraph. Maybe it's encouraging students to look for patterns in historical events or literary themes instead of just memorizing isolated facts.  The beauty of starting small is that it allows you to build confidence gradually. Each small success gives you the courage to try something slightly more ambitious next time. And your students will grow alongside you—they'll get more comfortable with data-focused thinking, and you'll get more comfortable facilitating these kinds of investigations.  Remember, you don't need fancy technology or complex datasets to begin. Some of the most powerful data science learning happens with simple tools and student-generated data. The sophistication comes from the thinking processes you guide students through, not from the tools you use.  "

  "body": " Reflection and Application: Embracing the Learning Journey  Now it's time to put these ideas into practice. This section will help you identify connections between data science and your existing strengths, while also planning low-stakes ways to begin integrating data science thinking into your classroom. Most importantly, we'll explore how to model the learning process for your students.   Modeling the Learning Process for Students   One of the most powerful ways to support student learning is to show them that learning involves iteration, making mistakes, and trying again. This is especially important in data science, where the process of investigation often involves false starts and course corrections.     Think about a time when you learned something new as an adult (this could be a hobby, a technology skill, a new teaching strategy, etc.). Describe the process: What did you try first? What didn't work? How did you adjust your approach? What finally helped it \"click\"?    How could you share this learning story with your students in a way that helps them understand that struggle and revision are normal parts of learning? What specific message would you want them to take away?    Think of an upcoming lesson or activity where students might struggle or make mistakes. How could you frame this as \"productive struggle\" rather than failure? What language could you use to normalize the process of trying, adjusting, and trying again?    How might you make your own learning process visible to students when you try data science activities together? What would it look like to genuinely learn alongside them rather than pretending to already know everything?        Connecting Data Science to Your Existing Strengths   Data science isn't as foreign as it might seem—it builds on thinking processes and skills you already use regularly. Let's identify these connections to build your confidence.      Data Science as Storytelling: How is working with data similar to helping students understand and tell stories? Consider how both involve identifying key information, recognizing patterns, making connections, and communicating findings to others. What specific storytelling skills do you use that could apply to data work?     Data Science as Student Assessment: Think about how you currently analyze student learning data (test scores, observations, work samples, etc.). What processes do you use to identify patterns, track progress, and make instructional decisions? How is this similar to what data scientists do?     Data Science as Problem-Solving: Describe your approach when you encounter a challenge in your teaching (low engagement, a concept students aren't grasping, etc.). How do you gather information, try different strategies, and evaluate what's working? How does this mirror the data science process?     Your Unique Strengths: What are you already really good at as a teacher? How might these strengths actually be advantages in data science education? (For example: strong questioning skills, ability to facilitate discussions, talent for making abstract concepts concrete, etc.)        Low-Stakes Ways to Involve Students in Data Work   Often, the most effective way to begin integrating data science is to \"offload\" some of the work you're already doing onto your students. This not only introduces them to data science thinking but often results in deeper learning and engagement.      Data Collection: Think about information you currently gather or present to students (attendance patterns, weather data for science, historical statistics, survey results, etc.). How could you have students collect this data themselves instead of you providing it? What would they learn from the collection process?     Pattern Recognition: Consider a lesson where you typically point out patterns or trends to students. How could you instead present the data and ask students to identify the patterns themselves? What questions could you ask to guide their analysis?     Making Comparisons: Think about times when you compare different options, time periods, locations, or approaches in your teaching. How could students collect and compare this data themselves? What tools could they use to organize and present their comparisons?     Classroom Management Data: What classroom routines or procedures could students help track and analyze? (Examples: time spent on different activities, participation patterns, effectiveness of different classroom arrangements, etc.) How might involving them in this analysis improve both their data skills and your classroom community?     Assessment and Reflection: How could students participate more actively in tracking and analyzing their own learning progress? What data could they collect about their own growth, challenges, or learning strategies?        Building Your Confidence Action Plan   Based on your reflections in this chapter, create a specific plan for building your confidence with data science while supporting your students' learning.      One Connection to Celebrate: Choose one connection between data science and your existing skills that most resonates with you. How will you remind yourself of this connection when you feel uncertain about trying data science activities?     One Low-Stakes Experiment: From your reflections above, choose one small change you could make in the next two weeks—something where you let students take on more of the data work.

  "title": "Modeling the Learning Process for Students.",
  "body": " Modeling the Learning Process for Students   One of the most powerful ways to support student learning is to show them that learning involves iteration, making mistakes, and trying again. This is especially important in data science, where the process of investigation often involves false starts and course corrections.     Think about a time when you learned something new as an adult (this could be a hobby, a technology skill, a new teaching strategy, etc.). Describe the process: What did you try first? What didn't work? How did you adjust your approach? What finally helped it \"click\"?    How could you share this learning story with your students in a way that helps them understand that struggle and revision are normal parts of learning? What specific message would you want them to take away?    Think of an upcoming lesson or activity where students might struggle or make mistakes. How could you frame this as \"productive struggle\" rather than failure? What language could you use to normalize the process of trying, adjusting, and trying again?    How might you make your own learning process visible to students when you try data science activities together? What would it look like to genuinely learn alongside them rather than pretending to already know everything?      "

This not only introduces them to data science thinking but often results in deeper learning and engagement.      Data Collection: Think about information you currently gather or present to students (attendance patterns, weather data for science, historical statistics, survey results, etc.). How could you have students collect this data themselves instead of you providing it? What would they learn from the collection process?     Pattern Recognition: Consider a lesson where you typically point out patterns or trends to students. How could you instead present the data and ask students to identify the patterns themselves? What questions could you ask to guide their analysis?     Making Comparisons: Think about times when you compare different options, time periods, locations, or approaches in your teaching. How could students collect and compare this data themselves? What tools could they use to organize and present their comparisons?     Classroom Management Data: What classroom routines or procedures could students help track and analyze? (Examples: time spent on different activities, participation patterns, effectiveness of different classroom arrangements, etc.) How might involving them in this analysis improve both their data skills and your classroom community?     Assessment and Reflection: How could students participate more actively in tracking and analyzing their own learning progress?

  "title": "The Six Core Data Moves",
  "body": " The Six Core Data Moves   Research has identified six fundamental data moves that appear consistently across data analysis contexts. These moves can be combined and applied in various orders to transform data for specific analytical purposes.    Filtering: Focusing Your Data   Filtering creates a subset of data by removing cases that don't meet specific criteria. Filtering serves two main purposes: scoping (removing irrelevant data) and slicing (reducing complexity to gain insight).   Temperature Data Filtering  Consider a dataset with 17,500 temperature measurements taken every 30 minutes throughout 2000. Plotting all data points shows a general relationship between air and soil temperature, but filtering to show only one day (May 19, 2000) reveals a clear diurnal pattern that was hidden in the full dataset.    Learning Progression Connections:   Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Filter data based on groups or subsets relevant to the problem  Identifying Patterns (C.2.3): Using filtering to reveal relationships and trends  Sense-making with Visualizations (E.1.1): Creating visualizations to summarize complex ideas     Filtering Practice   Using a dataset of student survey responses about technology use:  Filter to show only high school students  Filter to show only responses from the last month  Combine filters to show high school students from the last month who use social media daily  Discuss how each filter changes what patterns you can observe.      Grouping: Organizing for Comparison   Grouping divides a dataset into multiple subsets based on shared characteristics. While filtering restricts analysis to a single subset, grouping creates multiple subsets for comparison. Binning is a special type of grouping that uses ranges of continuous values.  Grouping is fundamental for making comparisons and is often a prerequisite for summarizing data. The way you define groups can dramatically affect what patterns emerge from your analysis.   Height Data Grouping  To create a histogram of height data, you group people into height ranges (bins). Choosing narrow bins (5 cm ranges) versus wide bins (20 cm ranges) will reveal very different patterns in the distribution.    Learning Progression Connections:   Frequency Tables (C.1.4): Organize data into frequency tables based on shared characteristics  Comparing Variables (C.2.1): Use reasoning about distributions to compare two groups  Summarizing Groups (B.1.4): Create summary measures for groups      Summarizing: Creating Aggregate Measures   Summarizing produces aggregate values that describe groups or entire datasets. While the mean is common, summary measures include any statistic that consolidates multiple values into a single measure: median, mode, standard deviation, counts, percentages, etc.  Summarizing often works together with grouping to create simpler displays that highlight overall patterns. However, this consolidation always involves information loss — when showing only measures of center, variability information disappears.   Height by Age and Gender  Starting with 800 individual height measurements, you can:  Group by age and gender (creating 30 groups)  Calculate mean height for each group (summarizing)  Create a graph with 30 points instead of 800, clearly showing growth patterns      Learning Progression Connections:   Measures of Center (C.1.1): Calculate summaries for categorical and numeric data  Measures of Spread (C.1.2): Calculate standard deviation and interquartile range  Understanding Distributions (C.2.2): Represent variability using numerical measures      Calculating: Creating New Attributes   Calculating creates new attributes (columns) using formulas applied to existing data. New attributes can be conceptual (like Body Mass Index combining height and weight) or convenience attributes (like converting units or creating categories).  Calculated attributes expand analytical possibilities by:  Combining multiple measurements into meaningful indices  Converting continuous variables into categories  Creating relative measures (percentages, ratios)  Standardizing units or formats     Body Mass Index Calculation  From height (cm) and weight (kg) measurements, calculate BMI:  BMI = (weight \/ height²) × 10000  This new attribute provides health professionals with a standardized measure that's more informative than weight alone.    Learning Progression Connections:   Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Use calculations and logic statements to create new attributes  Defining Relationships (C.2.3): Use data to create new groupings or construct new measures  Tool Application (C.4.1): Perform data analysis using digital tools      Merging and Joining: Combining Datasets   Merging and joining combine multiple datasets. Simple merging concatenates datasets about the same phenomenon from different sources. Joining adds new attributes about existing cases by connecting datasets through common identifiers.  Real-world data often comes in separate tables that must be connected. Health surveys, for example, might store demographic information separately from medical measurements, requiring joins to create complete analytical datasets.   Health Survey Data Joining  The NHANES health survey stores data in separate tables:  Demographics table : ID, Age, Gender  Measurements table : ID, Height, Weight, Blood Pressure  Using the ID field, you can join these tables to analyze relationships between demographic characteristics and health measurements.    Learning Progression Connections:   Processing and Transformation (B.1.3): Use an identifying attribute to merge datasets  Complexity of Structure (B.4.4): Merge multiple datasets while maintaining appropriate case structure  Finding Secondary Data (B.2.4): Combine multiple secondary datasets to create comprehensive data      Making Hierarchy: Restructuring Data Relationships   Making hierarchy organizes data into nested levels where some cases become parents containing other child cases. This move is particularly powerful because it provides an elegant way to think about grouping and summarizing.  Hierarchical organization allows analysts to:  Manipulate dataset structure for specific purposes  Create summary measures as first-class variables  Work with naturally nested data (students within schools, individuals within households)  Build more sophisticated analytical models     Household Data Hierarchy  Census data includes both individual and household information. By creating a hierarchy with households as parents and individuals as children, you can:  Calculate household size (count of individuals per household)  Analyze relationships between household characteristics and individual outcomes  Compare household-level patterns across different regions      Learning Progression Connections:   Organizing and Structure (B.1.2): Create hierarchical data structures with multiple related tables  Understanding Modeling (C.5.1): Recognize that models simplify complex systems  Complexity of Structure (B.4.4): Design data structures for longitudinal data and multiple aggregation levels     "

You want to compare average rainfall between northern and southern regions of your state.  You have separate datasets for student demographics and test scores, both containing student ID numbers.  You want to create age categories (child, teen, adult, senior) from a dataset with exact birth dates.  You want to analyze how household income relates to individual education levels using census data.     "

  "body": " Sequencing Data Moves   Design a sequence of data moves to answer this question: Do students at larger schools perform better on standardized tests than students at smaller schools? Available data:  Student test scores with student IDs  School enrollment data with school IDs  Student-school assignments linking student IDs to school IDs  For each move in your sequence, explain:  Which specific data move you're applying  Why this move is necessary  How it prepares the data for subsequent steps     "

  "body": " Ethical Analysis of Data Moves   Consider a dataset about job applications that includes information about applicant names, education, experience, and hiring decisions. You want to analyze whether there are differences in hiring rates across different groups.  What data moves would you need to perform this analysis?  What ethical considerations arise from each move?  How might your choices in performing these moves affect your conclusions?  What steps could you take to ensure your analysis is fair and transparent?     "

  "body": " Complete Data Analysis Project   Choose a publicly available dataset relevant to your classroom and what your students' interests are (suggestions: sports, social media, education, health, environment, economics). Conduct a complete analysis that demonstrates all six core data moves and think about how you can not only teach these steps to your students (depending on age), but also how you can now use this dataset in your classroom going forward to achieve some of your learning objectives.  Your analysis should include:  Plan: Formulate a clear research question  Document: Keep a log of every data move you perform  Implement: Apply filtering, grouping, summarizing, calculating, merging (if applicable), and hierarchy creation  Reflect: Analyze how each move contributed to answering your question  Communicate: Present your findings with clear visualizations and explanations     "
